Dear Rigoberto,

After a convincing victory in Oregon and virtual tie in Kentucky on Tuesday, 
our campaign now pivots to California â€“ where a whopping 475 pledged 
delegates will be at stake in the June 7th election.

We have a great opportunity in California, but we have to act fast. Hundreds 
of thousands of Californians want to vote for our progressive agenda and a 
candidate who can defeat Donald Trump handily. But to vote for Bernie, these 
Californians must be registered as a Democrat (or "no party preference," and 
request a Democratic ballot) no later than this Monday May 23rd.

That's where we come in! Fortunately, California offers online voter 
registration, so we're calling targeted voters in California this weekend to 
remind them of the opportunity to re-register and vote for Bernie. If 
everyone who supports Bernie puts in just an hour or two to call 
Californians, we'll have a yuuuge impact. Will you help out?

Yes, I'll help Bernie win California by calling to register voters 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/get-california-registered?source=em160519a>

If you've never called voters for Bernie before, don't worry. It's pretty 
easy. You just need a computer or a tablet, and a phone. We provide a simple 
script for you to follow, and there are helpful volunteers standing by on 
livechat to assist if you need.

We're staying in this fight because each and every vote cast for our 
campaign sends a strong message to the political establishment that we will 
not continue to accept the status quo of a corrupt political system that 
holds in place a rigged economy. Every state we win and vote we earn 
strengthens our hand in delivering that message at the convention in 
Philadelphia.

So we hope you'll continue fighting with us and keep this political 
revolution rolling strong.

Sign up to call some California voters this weekend. 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/get-california-registered?source=em160519b>

In solidarity,

Team Bernie

P.S. If you'd like to hear directly from our organizing staff about this 
California project and our goals for the rest of the campaign, please join 
us on a special livestream event tonight <http://bernie.to/volstream> 
(Thursday) at 8 pm ET/5 pm PT.



I can't volunteer, but I'll contribute
