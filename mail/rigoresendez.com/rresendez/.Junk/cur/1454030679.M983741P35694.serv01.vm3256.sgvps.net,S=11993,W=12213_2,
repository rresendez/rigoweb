Rigoberto -

When we started this campaign, no one gave us a chance. But then 6,000 
people showed up at our announcement speech in Burlington. Our crowds 
swelled to 10,000 in Madison, 15,000 in Seattle and 27,500 in Los Angeles, 
California.

Our volunteer base grew larger than any other campaign. At the same time, we 
rose in the polls nationally and trimmed Hillary Clinton’s lead down to 
single digits in Iowa.

Together, we proved that when Americans stand together, we could raise 
enough money to take on the billionaire class. Thirty thousand contributions 
on our first day. Our millionth contribution in September. Two million in 
December. And a chance to reach 3 million before Iowa, just one month later.

But out of every contribution you've made — none is more important than the 
one you can make right now, because tomorrow is the last day we can put it 
to work to win Iowa.
