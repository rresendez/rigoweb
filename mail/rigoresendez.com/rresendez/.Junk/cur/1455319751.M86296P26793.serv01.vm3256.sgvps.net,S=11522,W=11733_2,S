Rigoberto -

Remember that kitchen sink? Here it comes…

The Washington Post just reported that Hillary Clinton’s largest super PAC 
is set to spend at least $5 million supporting her campaign in primary 
contests happening in the coming weeks.

This is the same super PAC that came up in last night’s debate, the one 
“Clinton attempted to distance herself from,” according to the Washington 
Post. The one that recently received $15 million in Wall Street and 
financial industry money to boost her campaign.

Here’s the truth: our campaign is funded by more than 3.75 million 
contributions made by people like you, responding to emails like this one. 
You should be very proud of that fact. But if we’re going to avoid getting 
beat by the crush of Clinton super PAC spending, we have to ask again:

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/clinton-super-pac?refcode=em160212full>Make another $15 contribution to our campaign as a way of saying you havehad more than ENOUGH of super PACs buying our candidates and elections.You know that the issue of money in politics is central to our campaign. It’s one of the reasons we’ve come so far, so fast. It would be a shame if asuper PAC flush with Wall Street cash is one of the reasons we come up justshort in the contests ahead.That’s why your contribution is so important.In solidarity,Jeff WeaverCampaign ManagerBernie 2016Contribute<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/clinton-super-pac?refcode=em160212full>Paid for by Bernie 2016  <https://s.bsd.net/bernie16/main/page/-/website/billionaires.png>PO Box 905 - Burlington VT 05402 United States - (855) 4-BERNIEThis email was sent to rresendez@rigoresendez.com.
