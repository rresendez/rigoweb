Rigoberto -

Last night we sent a message that will echo from Wall Street to Washington, 
from Maine to California. And that is that the government of this great 
nation belongs to all of the people, and not just a handful of wealthy 
campaign contributors and their super PACs.

As you may have heard in my speech last night, I am in New York today. But I 
am not here for a Wall Street fundraiser. This campaign is funded by people 
like you, responding to emails like this — working Americans — giving an 
average of $27 apiece, some of whom can hardly afford the contribution.

Our success has clearly set off some alarm bells inside of the political 
establishment and among the nation’s financial elite. They’ve thrown 
everything at us but the kitchen sink, and I expect that will be coming soon 
as well.

With 14 primaries and caucuses in the next three weeks, we’ll need to be 
ready. That’s why I have to ask you directly:

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our-best-chance?refcode=em160210full-e>Can I count on you to contribute another $5 to our political revolutiontoday? It could mean the difference in Nevada, South Carolina, and on SuperTuesday.What everyone learned with the record-breaking turnout in New Hampshire lastnight is that our campaign is the Democratic Party’s best chance to harnessthe energy and enthusiasm we will need to succeed in November.When voter turnout is high, Democrats and progressives win. When voterturnout is low and people are demoralized, Republicans win.What we are building together is a political revolution that will bring tensof millions of people together. Working people who have given up not thepolitical process. Blacks and whites, Latinos, Asian Americans, NativeAmericans, straight and gay, male and female, people who were born inAmerica and people who immigrated here.And what we are saying, loudly and clearly, is that this government belongsto all of us, and not just a wealthy few. That is what this campaign isabout. That is the political revolution. <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our-best-chance?refcode=em160210full-e> Make another $5 contribution to our campaign today to help grow thepolitical revolution that will win the White House and take back our countryfrom the billionaire class.I am overwhelmed, and I am moved by your continued support. And I know thatif we continue to stand together, we will win.In solidarity,Bernie SandersContribute<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our-best-chance?refcode=em160210full-e>Paid for by Bernie 2016  <https://s.bsd.net/bernie16/main/page/-/website/billionaires.png>PO Box 905 - Burlington VT 05402 United States - (855) 4-BERNIEThis email was sent to rresendez@rigoresendez.com.
