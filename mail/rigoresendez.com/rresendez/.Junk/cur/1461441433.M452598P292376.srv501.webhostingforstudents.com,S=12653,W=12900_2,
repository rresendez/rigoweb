Rigoberto -

One of the reasons Bernie has done so well throughout this campaign is 
because he is telling the truth about the reality of American life today. 
And right now, I want to tell you the truth about the reality of this race:

You already know that the New York primary was a tough loss. But there are 
five more primaries in less than one week and we are going fight for every 
single vote and every single delegate.

Not just because we are going to do everything we can to win, but because 
every single vote, and every single delegate for Bernie Sanders is a 
declaration of support for the values we share.

Together, we are the most powerful force for change in American politics 
today. Our political revolution has already forced a former U.S. Senator and 
Secretary of State to change her mind on matters as critical as 
international trade, the Keystone Pipeline, and the federal minimum wage. 
And with every vote and every victory, we grow stronger. That’s why I have 
to ask:

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/a-declaration-of-support?refcode=em160423-v2-full>Can Bernie count on you to make a $15 contribution to our campaign today tohelp us win, and as a way of saying YOU WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING for thevalues we share?The New York Times reported that just this week the Clinton campaign "hostedhundreds of bundlers" at a Manhattan hotel to "focus on bolstering herfund-raising for the contest against Mr. Sanders." Her millionaire andbillionaire backers are still fighting, because for them our campaign isabout more than an election — our success threatens their way of life. That’s why the head of Goldman Sachs said Bernie is "dangerous."He is right. We are dangerous for Wall Street and the billionaire class ofthis country. And with every contribution, every vote, and every delegate,we become even more powerful. That's why your contribution matters.In solidarity,Jeff WeaverCampaign ManagerBernie 2016Contribute<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/a-declaration-of-support?refcode=em160423-v2-full>Paid for by Bernie 2016  <https://s.bsd.net/bernie16/main/page/-/website/billionaires.png>PO Box 905 - Burlington VT 05402 United States - (855) 4-BERNIEThis email was sent to rresendez@rigoresendez.com.
