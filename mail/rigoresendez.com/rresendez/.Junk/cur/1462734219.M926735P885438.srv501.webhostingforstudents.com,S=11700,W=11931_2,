Rigoberto -

Now that Ted Cruz and John Kasich have dropped out, it looks almost certain 
that Donald Trump will accept the Republican Party's presidential nomination 
in Cleveland this July.

So there's been a lot of talk over the past few days about how Democrats and 
independents must do everything we can to defeat Trump in November. And we 
must! Because a President Trump would be a catastrophe.

But it's not enough to just be against Donald Trump. We also need to be for 
a bold platform.

Every vote we earn, delegate we claim, and state we win between now and the 
convention amplifies that message exponentially. And that's why it's 
important that I ask:

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/never-trump?refcode=em160508-s2-nonEL>Can Bernie count on you to match your previous $15 contribution today?Adding one more donation will ensure we have the resources to win WestVirginia on Tuesday and fight all the way through the Democratic convention.The Democratic Party is the party that passed the Social Security Act, a 40hour work week and the minimum wage, Medicare, the Civil Rights Act and muchmore. Surely we can aspire to more than simply convincing enough Americansthat a reality television star should never be our president.This moment in our history calls for transformational change. And withDonald Trump as the Republican Party's nominee, it is within our grasp. Butonly if we're willing to reach just a bit further than the establishmentsays is possible.In solidarity,Jeff WeaverCampaign ManagerBernie 2016Contribute<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/never-trump?refcode=em160508-s2-nonEL>Paid for by Bernie 2016  <https://s.bsd.net/bernie16/main/page/-/website/billionaires.png>PO Box 905 - Burlington VT 05402 United States - (855) 4-BERNIEThis email was sent to rresendez@rigoresendez.com.
