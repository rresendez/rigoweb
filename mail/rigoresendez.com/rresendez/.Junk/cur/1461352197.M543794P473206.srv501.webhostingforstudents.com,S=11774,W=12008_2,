Since our campaign started fifty-one weeks ago, we've been through a lot 
together, Rigoberto â€“ to say the least. As we've gone toe-to-toe with the 
political establishment, Wall Street, super PACs, and the billionaire class, 
I want to remind you of something.

The media likes to portray this as a fair fight on even footing. They seem 
to forget that when we started our campaign on April 30, we barely 
registered in the polls. We didn't have a political organization, we didn't 
have millionaires waiting in the wings. Quite frankly, we didn't have a 
whole lot. And then millions of people came together in a political 
revolution.

The latest national poll average shows us just 1.4 percent behind Secretary 
Clinton. We've erased a 55-point advantage she once held over our campaign. 
That is really quite something.
