I’ve told you throughout this campaign, Rigoberto, that no candidate for 
president, not Bernie Sanders, not the greatest president you could possibly 
imagine, can take on the billionaire class alone.

When I am elected president, I am going to need progressives in Congress who 
are willing to continue the fight we started in this campaign. Here are 
three:

Zephyr Teachout literally wrote the book on political corruption and is 
running for Congress in New York. Pramila Jayapal helped lead the fight for 
a $15 minimum wage and paid sick leave in Seattle, where she’s now running 
for Congress. Lucy Flores is a progressive champion running for Congress in 
Nevada and one of the most courageous people I’ve met on the campaign. I 
need them with me in Washington, D.C., and that’s why I have to ask:

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/we-need-progressives-in-congress?refcode=em160413-s2-full>Split a $15 contribution between Bernie 2016 and Lucy Flores, ZephyrTeachout, and Pramila Jayapal for Congress today and we are going to winthis primary AND elect a Congress willing to stand up billionaire class ofthis country.Change almost never happens from the top down, it almost always occurs fromthe bottom up. I will do everything I can from the White House, but whatthis moment requires is people in the streets fighting for change, andelecting a Congress that is willing to stand with them.If we are able to successfully combine those three elements, nothing will beable to stop us. That is the political revolution.In solidarity,Bernie SandersContribute<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/we-need-progressives-in-congress?refcode=em160413-s2-full>Paid for by Bernie 2016  <https://s.bsd.net/bernie16/main/page/-/website/billionaires.png>PO Box 905 - Burlington VT 05402 United States - (855) 4-BERNIEThis email was sent to rresendez@rigoresendez.com.
