Rigoberto -

Here's the truth: for the past several days, the entirety of the Democratic 
political establishment has been hoping our political revolution would 
dissolve, that we would just go away. But one thing is clear, we are only 
getting stronger:

YouGov National Poll - April 27, 2016
Clinton: 47%
Sanders: 43%

Those numbers represent a four point gain for our campaign, and it comes 
entirely after our tough loss in New York. Numbers like that can't be 
ignored because it proves our movement is resilient and will never stop 
fighting for the values we share.

And there's one more set of numbers everyone is waiting to see: what we 
report when our April fundraising deadline comes to a close in just a few 
hours. That's why we have to ask, one last time:

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/april_deadline?refcode=em160430-s3>Can Bernie count on you to add one more $15 contribution to our campaignbefore our critical FEC fundraising deadline comes to a close at midnight asa way of saying we are still in this fight together?This fundraising deadline isn't just about how much money we raise, but howmany individual contributions we receive to power this campaign through theremaining primaries and the Democratic convention.
