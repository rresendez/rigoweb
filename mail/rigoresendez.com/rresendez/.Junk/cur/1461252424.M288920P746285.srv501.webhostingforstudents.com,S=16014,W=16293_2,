Dear Rigoberto,

New York wasn't the result we were looking for. But we still have a path to 
the nomination, and our plan is to win the pledged delegates in this 
primary.

Let's be clear: we put more than 3 million calls into New York last weekend, 
and turned out a HUGE number of voters for Bernie. They voted for Bernie, 
for his ideas, and for our movement. And for each voter we contact 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/the-revolution-is-calling?source=em160421> 
, we'll win more states, win more pledged delegates, and win the nomination.

This coming Tuesday, five more states vote, with 384 delegates up for grabs. 
We need to win every delegate possible in these contests to take a big bite 
out of our opponent's lead before the primary season moves westward.

So we're calling for an all-hands-on-deck mobilization this Saturday through 
Monday to find Bernie supporters in the April 26th states and get them out 
to vote. Will you pitch in?

Yes, I'll get on the phones for Bernie this weekend 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/the-revolution-is-calling?source=em160421>

 <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/the-revolution-is-calling?source=em160421>Our goal for this weekend is 20,000 callers phonebanking on Saturday throughMonday – which is very ambitious. But if we can hit our goal for callers,together we'll make over 3.5 MILLION calls into the states that vote nextTuesday, which could make a yuuuge difference in some of these races.Sign up to make some calls this weekend.<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/the-revolution-is-calling?source=em160421>If you’ve never made phone calls to voters before, don’t worry. It’s easy.All you need is a computer or a tablet and a phone. There’s a simple scriptfor you to follow, and there are volunteers standing by on livechat to helpif you get stuck. You can call on your own from anywhere, or click here tofind a phonebank event with other Bernie supporters near you.<http://map.berniesanders.com/#zipcode=78539&distance=20&sort=time&f%5B%5D=campaign-office&f%5B%5D=phonebank>Despite disappointing results from New York – where we were playing on ouropponent's home turf, and under some of the most onerous voter registrationrequirements in the country – we are going to campaign hard until the verylast primary votes are cast in June.
