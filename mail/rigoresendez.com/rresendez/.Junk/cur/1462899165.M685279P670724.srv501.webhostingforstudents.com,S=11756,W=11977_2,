Rigoberto -

The corporate media have always treated this race as if it was over. The 
political establishment hopes we’ll all just fall in line. But if you’re 
looking for a sign that the Clinton campaign knows this primary is far from 
finished, here it is:

"Clinton back on the air with TV ads" - Politico, May 9, 2016

The article concludes with this line, "Clinton’s campaign is eager to stop 
Sanders from gaining momentum with a string of victories through May." But 
here’s the truth: there is no stopping a set of ideas whose time has come, 
no matter how many ads they run.

West Virginia votes today. Oregon and Kentucky hold their primaries in one 
week. It’s been a pretty crazy election, and I know that if we continue to 
stand together, anything is possible.

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/every-last-vote?refcode=em160510-s1-full-e>Add another $15 contribution to our campaign today and we are going to dovery well in West Virginia, Oregon, and Kentucky. From there it’s on toCalifornia, New Jersey and the rest of the June 7th states, where there isso much at stake.Last week’s victory in Indiana was a tremendous surprise to the corporatemedia and political establishment. Hopefully we’ll enjoy the same resultlater tonight in West Virginia and in Oregon and Kentucky next week. Bernie’s working hard, the staff and volunteers are doing the same. The rest is upto all of us.In solidarity,Jeff WeaverCampaign ManagerBernie 2016Contribute<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/every-last-vote?refcode=em160510-s1-full-e>Paid for by Bernie 2016  <https://s.bsd.net/bernie16/main/page/-/website/billionaires.png>PO Box 905 - Burlington VT 05402 United States - (855) 4-BERNIEThis email was sent to rresendez@rigoresendez.com.
