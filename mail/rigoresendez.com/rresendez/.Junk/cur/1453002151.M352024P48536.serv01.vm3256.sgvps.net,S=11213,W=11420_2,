Rigoberto -

With just two weeks to go before the Iowa caucuses, the super PAC 
coordinating with Hillary Clinton’s campaign is reportedly launching one of 
the most desperate and vile attacks imaginable: they are insinuating Bernie 
is too old and unhealthy to be our next president.

Let me be very clear with you: Bernie is in excellent health. But this 
personal attack is another example of a sickness in our democracy when it is 
so easy for millionaires and billionaires to buy up candidates and 
elections.

We are just three points behind in Iowa, but closing every day. We can’t let 
super PAC attacks on Bernie’s health and health care plan scare people away 
from voting for Bernie.
