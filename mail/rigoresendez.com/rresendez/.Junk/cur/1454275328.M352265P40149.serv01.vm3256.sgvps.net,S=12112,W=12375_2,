Rigoberto -

Time is running out before our Iowa caucus fundraising deadline at midnight, 
so I need to take a moment to share with you why these emails are so 
important to our campaign.

Earlier this week, Hillary Clinton left Iowa to attend a financial services 
fundraiser on the East Coast. We don’t know how much she raised, but it must 
have been many millions to compel her to leave the state in the critical 
days before the caucus. At the same time, her largest super PAC started a 
massive series of advertisements to tip the balance in her favor.

But you know Bernie. He doesn’t go around asking millionaires and 
billionaires for money. There’s no super PAC waiting in the wings. Emails 
like this one fund our campaign.

The clock is ticking and we’re getting so close to our goal of 3 million 
individual contributions made online, so we have to ask before midnight:

Can Bernie count on you to make one more $5 contribution to our campaign? It 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/m/24fb2c45/43b7f9e2/7e9b58e5/6209ec5b/1028051444/VEsH/> 
’s the last chance to contribute and have the maximum impact before the Iowa 
caucus. This is important.

There’s only three days before the Iowa caucus, and we are neck and neck. 
How we perform will have a tremendous impact on the future of our political 
revolution. It is no exaggeration to say the entire country and much of the 
world will be watching to see if we have what it takes to defeat the 
billionaire class, starting here in Iowa on Monday.

History has its eyes on us.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver
Campaign Manager
