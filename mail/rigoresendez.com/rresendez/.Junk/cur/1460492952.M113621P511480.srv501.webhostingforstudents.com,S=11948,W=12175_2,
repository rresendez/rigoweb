Rigoberto -

New York has enthusiastically welcomed Bernie back to his childhood home 
with open arms. Well, most of New York. There’s one very small part of the 
state that isn’t so excited to see him return.

Can you guess where?

An article titled "Jamie Dimon’s not-so-subtle warning for Bernie Sanders" 
welcomed our campaign to New York with this message from the Wall Street 
CEO: "Jamie Dimon waved a placard at Bernie Sanders in his annual 
shareholders letter on Wednesday. It says, in effect: 'Don’t Bite the Hand 
That Feeds Us.'"

Here’s the truth: from day one, Wall Street has contributed more than $21 
million to Hillary Clinton’s campaign and super PACs, and they are going to 
do everything they can to stop us in New York. Because if we can win there, 
we’re going to win everywhere. The stakes are high in these next two weeks, 
and that’s why we have to ask:

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/a-message-from-wall-street?refcode=em160412-full-d>You made a $15 contribution earlier in the campaign, and that’s part of thereason we’ve done so well. If you match that donation today, we will havethe resources we need to beat Wall Street in the New York primary.In less than one year, our campaign has received more individualcontributions than Barack Obama did during the entirety of his historic 2008campaign — almost 7 million so far! But we cannot afford to stop now, and itis how we respond in this moment that could be the difference betweenvictory and defeat for our political revolution.
