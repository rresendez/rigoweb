Rigoberto,

The world is going to have answers to two very important questions about our 
campaign in about three weeks.

1.	Are we able to bring all of our nearly 1,900 delegates to the Democratic 
convention in Philadelphia, where with Bernie they will cast important votes 
for a progressive platform that includes issues like opposition to a vote 
against the disastrous TPP, or a $15 federal minimum wage?

2.	Will the FEC fundraising report we must file days before the convention 
show that we have the momentum and the power to continue the incredible work 
of our political revolution?

I want the answers to both of those questions to be yes, Rigoberto. The 
future of our movement depends on it. Can you help before the FEC deadline 
at midnight?
