Yesterday the CEO of Verizon said that I was "contemptible." He doesn't like 
that yesterday I walked the picket line with striking Verizon workers, or 
that I think Verizon needs to pay its fair share in taxes.

Verizon's attack reminded me of what President Franklin Delano Roosevelt 
said in New York City in 1936:

"We had to struggle with the old enemies of peace — business and financial 
monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sectionalism, war 
profiteering.

"They had begun to consider the Government of the United States as a mere 
appendage to their own affairs. We know now that Government by organized 
money is just as dangerous as Government by organized mob.

"Never before in all our history have these forces been so united against 
one candidate as they stand today. They are unanimous in their hate for me — 
and I welcome their hatred."

Like FDR, I welcome the contempt of Verizon's CEO. I welcome the hatred and 
contempt of every Wall Street banker, hedge fund manager, pharmaceutical 
lobbyist and fracking executive trying to stop our campaign.

They know how powerful we are when we stand together. That's why I need to 
ask you directly.

You 
<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/contempt?refcode=em160414-full> 
’ve already made a $15 contribution to our campaign. Matching that donation 
right now ensures we will have the resources we need to win New York’s 
primary on Tuesday night.

I visited FDR's gravesite this week while I was campaigning in New York. I 
took the time to reflect on his presidency, and how he stood up to the 
powerful interests on Wall Street who wrecked the nation's economy and sent 
our country spiraling into the Great Depression.

FDR thought big. When people said that Social Security was impossible, he 
defied them and created the safety net we have today. When people told him 
that he couldn't rein in Wall Street greed, he signed the Glass-Steagall Act 
into law.

Today we are thinking big, and the billionaire class is telling us what 
we're doing is impossible. People keep underestimating us, and we keep 
proving them wrong. Let's show them again on Tuesday in New York's primary.

Match your previous $15 contribution to our campaign today and ensure that 
we can win New York's primary, the Democratic nomination, and the White 
House. 
<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/contempt?refcode=em160414-full>

I'm going to be on stage for tonight's Democratic debate in a few hours, and 
I know that with your support, we can win.

Nothing is impossible.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders
