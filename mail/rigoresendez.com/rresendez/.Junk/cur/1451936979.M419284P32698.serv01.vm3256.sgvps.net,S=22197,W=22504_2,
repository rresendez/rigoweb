Contribute $5 to ourcampaign today.Dear Rigoberto,“I like to give on a scale where I can see impact...” - David KochEarlier this year, a number of Republicans flew to California to makefundraising pitches to more than four hundred wealthy conservative donorsattending a private conference hosted by the Koch brothers.It’s worth taking a moment to ask the question, who are the Koch brothers,and what do they want?The Koch brothers are the second-wealthiest family in America worth $82billion. For the Koch brothers, $82 billion in wealth apparently is not goodenough. Owning the second-largest private company in America is apparentlynot good enough. It doesn’t appear that they will be satisfied until theyare able to control the entire political process.This issue isn't personal for me. I don't know the Koch brothers, but I doknow this. They have advocated for destroying the federal programs that arecritical to the financial and personal health of middle class Americans.Now, most Americans know that the Koch brothers are the primary source offunding for the Tea Party, and that’s fine. They know that they favor theoutright repeal of the Affordable Care Act, and that’s their opinion. It’swrong, but that’s fine as well.But it is not widely known that David Koch once ran for Vice President ofthe United States of America on the Libertarian Party ticket because hebelieved Ronald Reagan was much too liberal. And he ran on a platform thatincluded the following:*	“We favor the repeal of the fraudulent, virtually bankrupt andincreasingly oppressive Social Security system.”*	“We favor the abolition of Medicare and Medicaid programs.”*	“We support repeal of all laws which impede the ability of any person tofind employment, such as minimum wage laws…”*	“We support the eventual repeal of all taxation.”In 1980, David Koch’s presidential ticket received one percent of the votefrom the American people. And rightly so. His views were so extreme theywere rejected completely out of hand by the American people.But fast forward almost thirty-six years, and one of the most significantrealities of modern politics is just how successful David Koch and thelike-minded billionaires attending his retreat have been at moving theRepublican Party to the extreme right. The ideas above that were dismissedas downright crazy in 1980 are now part of today’s mainstream Republicanthinking.The Koch brothers, and billionaires like them, have bought up the privatesector and now they’re buying up the government. It’s up to us to put a stopto them, but it will require all of us standing together with one voice onthis issue. <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/m/24fb2b1f/43b7f9e2/46f751e0/620fe1ee/1851744485/VEsE/> Your $5 donation to our campaign today is a contributiontowards the dismantling of a corrupt system of campaign finance held inplace by the Koch brothers and their billionaire friends.Donate $5<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/m/24fb2b1f/43b7f9e2/46f751e0/620fe1ee/1851744485/VEsF/>Here’s the truth: The economic and political systems of this country arestacked against ordinary Americans. The rich get richer and use their wealthto buy elections, and I believe that we cannot change this corrupt system bytaking its money. If we’re serious about creating jobs, health care for all,climate change, and the needs of our children and the elderly, we must beserious about campaign finance reform.So far in this election, less than four hundred families have contributedthe majority of all the money raised by all the candidates and super PACscombined. According to media reports, one family will spend more money inthis election than either the Democratic or Republican Parties.This is not democracy. This is oligarchy.Our job is not to think small in this moment. The current system of campaignfinance in this country is utterly corrupt. That is one of the reasons I amso proud of how we have funded our campaign — over 2.5 million contributionsfrom working Americans giving less than $30 at a time. But our campaign isunique.We must pass a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United, and Iwill not nominate any justice to the Supreme Court who does not make itabundantly clear that she or he will overturn that decision. We needlegislation that requires wealthy individuals and corporations who makelarge campaign contributions to disclose where their money is going. Andmore importantly, I believe we need to move towards the public funding ofelections.Our vision for American democracy should be a nation in which all people,regardless of their income, can participate in the political process, canrun for office without begging for contributions from the wealthy and thepowerful. <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/m/24fb2b1f/43b7f9e2/46f751e0/620fe1ee/1851744485/VEsC/> Your $5 donation to our campaign today is a contributiontowards the dismantling of a corrupt system of campaign finance held inplace by the Koch brothers and their billionaire friends.Tomorrow afternoon I’ll be in New York City to deliver a major speech aboutour need to create a financial system that works for all Americans, not justthe few.
