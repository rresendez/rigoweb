Rigoberto,

Donald Trump is scheduled to hold one of his rallies in Burlington, Vermont 
later tonight — the city where Bernie was mayor, and the city from which we 
are running our campaign for president.

But I want to share a little secret with you, one you won’t hear discussed 
much in the political media: our campaign is the best firewall preventing 
Donald Trump from ever getting into the White House. And today, on the day 
of his visit to Bernie’s home state, we’re going to make him pay to help us 
build it.

With less than four weeks before the first voters go to the Iowa caucuses, 
we need a sustained, predictable source of revenue to build this firewall 
against Donald Trump. ​Can you make a weekly recurring contribution to 
Bernie from now through the Iowa caucuses on February 1?
