Rigoberto,

Before our nearly 1,900 delegates can vote at the Democratic convention next 
month, we need to actually get them to Philadelphia.

Here's the thing: our delegates are not wealthy campaign contributors. 
They're not party insiders or establishment elites. They're working folks, 
and it's not easy for many of them to fly to Philly and stay in hotels for a 
week.

We really need to have all of our delegates at the Democratic convention 
because we expect there could be critical votes for the party platform and 
electoral process. We'd hate to fall short on these votes because some of 
our delegates couldn't afford to go to the convention.

That's why I'm asking you directly:

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our-delegates?refcode=em160628-full>Make a $15 contribution to our campaign before Thursday's midnight FECdeadline to help our delegates come to the Democratic convention so we canhave our entire political revolution represented next month in Philadelphia.You'd be shocked at how expensive it is to attend the Democratic convention.It can cost more than $4,000 per delegate!Hotels are booked months in advance, and then resold at higher prices.Lobbyists throw all sorts of fancy parties. It's easy for the politicalestablishment to navigate this and know whom to call to find the right wayin. That, or they're wealthy enough to pay for themselves.Our political revolution is not made up of people like that. Our folks needhelp to get to the convention and stay there.Rigoberto, you can make sure all our delegates represent Bernie at theDemocratic convention. Can you help us before Thursday's midnight FECfundraising deadline? <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our-delegates?refcode=em160628-full> Contribute $15 to our campaign and make sure that Bernie's delegatescan get to the Democratic convention next month.Thank you for stepping up to help the members of our political revolution.In solidarity,Jeff WeaverCampaign ManagerBernie 2016Contribute<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our-delegates?refcode=em160628-full>Paid for by Bernie 2016  <https://s.bsd.net/bernie16/main/page/-/website/billionaires.png>PO Box 905 - Burlington VT 05402 United States - (855) 4-BERNIEThis email was sent to rresendez@rigoresendez.com.
