Rigoberto,

Our campaign has always been about a grassroots movement of Americans 
standing up and saying: "Enough is enough. This country and our government 
belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires."

I just finished speaking at the Democratic National Convention, where I 
addressed the historic nature of our grassroots movement and what's next for 
our political revolution.

I hope that I made you proud. I know that Jane and I are very proud of you.

Our work will continue in the form of a new group called Our Revolution. The 
goal of this organization will be no different from the goal of our 
campaign: we must transform American politics to make our political and 
economic systems once again responsive to the needs of working families.

We cannot do this alone. All of us must be a part of Our Revolution.

 <https://ourrevolution.com/> Join Our Revolution and help continue our 
critical work to create a government which represents all of us, and not 
just the 1 percent – a government based on the principles of economic, 
social, racial and environmental justice. Add your name here.

When we started this campaign a little more than a year ago, the media and 
the political establishment considered us to be a "fringe" campaign. Well, 
we're not fringe anymore.

Thanks to your tireless work and generous contributions, we won 23 primaries 
and caucuses with more than 13 million votes, all of which led to the 1900 
delegates we have on the floor this week at the Democratic convention.

What we have done together is absolutely unprecedented, but there is so much 
more to do. It starts with defeating Donald Trump in November, and then 
continuing to fight for every single one of our issues in order to transform 
America.

We are going to fight to make sure that the most progressive platform in the 
history of the Democratic Party becomes law. This means working for a $15 
federal minimum wage, fighting for a national fracking ban, and so many more 
progressive priorities.

The political revolution needs you in order to make all this happen and 
more.

 <https://ourrevolution.com/> Add your name to say that you will join Our 
Revolution and be part of the fight for our progressive vision for America.

Thank you for being a part of the continued political revolution.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders
