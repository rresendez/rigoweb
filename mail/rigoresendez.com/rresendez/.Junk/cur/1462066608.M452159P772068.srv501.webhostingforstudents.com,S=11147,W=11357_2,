Rigoberto -

Wow. Ok, we didn't really know what to expect after Bernie's email this 
morning, but one thing is clear: our political revolution is ready, willing 
and able to continue our campaign to transform the Democratic Party and to 
transform our nation.

More than 20,000 people have already contributed to our campaign today, and 
they're continuing to pour in:
