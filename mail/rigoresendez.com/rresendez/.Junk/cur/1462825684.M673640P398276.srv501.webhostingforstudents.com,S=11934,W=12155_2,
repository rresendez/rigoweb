West Virginia votes tomorrow, and this primary matters, Rigoberto. A lot.

If we are able to win in West Virginia tomorrow, not only would we cut 
further into Secretary Clinton’s lead, but it will send a powerful message 
to the Democratic Party establishment about an issue at the heart of our 
campaign in that state: poverty.

When Bernie talks about transformational change in this country, he is 
talking about the millions of Americans who live in poverty, who have been 
tossed out, left behind, and abandoned by the rich and the powerful. People 
like those in McDowell County, West Virginia, where he visited last week.

So let’s go out and win this primary tomorrow, because doing so will send an 
unmistakable message that our political revolution demands more than 
incremental change. We want an economy that works for all of us, not just 
the 1 percent. But we need your help to get there:

She beat Barack Obama by 41 points. But we are doing very well,precisely because Bernie is willing to tell the truth about the issuesfacing working families across the this country, and what is required tochange course.If we continue to stand together and fight, I believe that we will wintomorrow.In solidarity,Jeff WeaverCampaign ManagerBernie 2016Contribute<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/west-virginia?refcode=em160509-s1-full>Paid for by Bernie 2016  <https://s.bsd.net/bernie16/main/page/-/website/billionaires.png>PO Box 905 - Burlington VT 05402 United States - (855) 4-BERNIEThis email was sent to rresendez@rigoresendez.com.
