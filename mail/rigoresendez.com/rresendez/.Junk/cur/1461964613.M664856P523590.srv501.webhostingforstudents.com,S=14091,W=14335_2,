I want you to read this note, Rigoberto. It’s one of thousands we’ve 
received from people who have contributed to our campaign this week urging 
Bernie to keep fighting for every vote and for every delegate all the way 
through the convention:

“I am a teacher and Bernie is the only candidate that is truly fighting for 
all of us. No other candidate has his platform of universal health care, a 
$15 minimum wage, and the rebuilding of our infrastructure. I will be with 
Bernie as long as he is willing to fight!” - Melissa from Massachusetts

We have an important FEC fundraising deadline tomorrow and the entire 
corporate media and political establishment will be looking to see just how 
many of Bernie’s supporters are willing to keep fighting for the issues that 
have powered this campaign from the start. That’s why we have to ask:
