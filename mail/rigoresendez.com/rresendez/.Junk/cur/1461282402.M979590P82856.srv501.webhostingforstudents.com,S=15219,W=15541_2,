Sisters and Brothers,

The CEO of Verizon makes almost $20 million a year in compensation. He leads 
one of the most profitable companies in the country.

Yet Verizon wants to take away employees' health benefits. Verizon wants to 
outsource decent-paying jobs. Verizon wants to avoid paying federal income 
tax. And right now, Verizon is refusing to sit down and negotiate a fair 
contract with its employees.

In other words, Verizon is just another major American corporation trying to 
destroy the lives of working Americans. But this time, Verizon's employees 
are fighting back.

Thousands of very brave employees of Verizon and Verizon Wireless are on 
strike until they can get a fair contract. They made a very difficult 
decision that puts their families at risk -- but it's a choice they made to 
stand up for justice against corporate greed.

I'm asking you today to stand up and tell the CEO of Verizon that you think 
Verizon employees deserve a fair contract that protects health benefits, 
guarantees fair pay, and stops outsourcing. Click here to add your name in 
support of Verizon employees.

 Â»

Twice last week in New York City I stood with Verizon workers in the 
streets. I did so because they're doing something very brave: they're 
standing up not just for themselves, but for the millions of Americans who 
don't have a union.

The working class of this country deserves to earn decent wages, decent 
benefits, and not see their jobs go to low-wage countries.

Verizon's CEO doesn't think that. He called me "contemptible" for saying 
that his employees need a fair contract, and that Verizon should pay its 
fair share in federal income taxes.

What I think is contemptible is CEOs with multi-million dollar compensation 
packages, presiding over extremely profitable companies, and still refusing 
to give their employees fair contracts.

Corporate greed is a scourge on this country, and it will take all of us 
standing up for justice in order to rein it in. One significant way you can 
stand up to corporate greed is by standing with Verizon employees who are 
out on strike.

Add your name and say you support Verizon employees who are standing up to 
the CEO in order to get a fair contract with health benefits, fair pay, and 
job protections.

Corporate America is slowly beginning to realize that they cannot have it 
all. Thanks for helping them know it.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders
