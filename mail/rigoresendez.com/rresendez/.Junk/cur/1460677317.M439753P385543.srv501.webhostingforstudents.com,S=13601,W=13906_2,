Dear Rigoberto,

We’re just five days out from the New York primary. This is an 
all-hands-on-deck moment, so we’re setting a huge and ambitious goal that 
could be the difference between victory and defeat: calling two million 
voters over the weekend.

To reach our goal, we need 15,000 of you to sign up to call New York voters 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/takenybyphone?source=em160414>  for at 
least an hour this Saturday or Sunday.

48 hours. 15,000 volunteers. Two million calls. Are you in?

Yes, I'll help Bernie win New York 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/takenybyphone?source=em160414>

 <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/takenybyphone?source=em160414>

If we reach 15,000 callers between Saturday and Sunday, we estimate we’ll 
make more than a million calls a day, which is yuuuuge. In fact, as far as 
we can tell, this could be the biggest virtual phonebank ever!

We’ll be honest: this is such an ambitious goal that we might not reach it. 
But this campaign is, after all, about doing big things. And if enough of us 
get on the phones this weekend, Tuesday could deliver yet another historic 
upset victory for Bernie.

Sign up to call New York. 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/takenybyphone?source=em160414>

If you’ve never made phone calls to voters before, don’t worry. It’s easy. 
All you need is a computer or a tablet and a phone. There’s a simple script 
for you to follow, and there are volunteers standing by on livechat to help 
if you get stuck.

Right now, in lower Manhattan, the Wall Street bankers, corporate media 
types, and Democratic party establishment figures are hoping you’ll sit this 
fight out. They know that a win in New York would put us in a strong 
position to win the nomination – and threaten the entire rigged system that 
benefits them personally.

Let’s show them that we too know how high the stakes are – by setting a 
historic record right before Tuesday’s vote. Sign up to call New York. 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/takenybyphone?source=em160414>

In solidarity,

Team Bernie
