Rigoberto: Since earlier today, 10,000 people have donated more than 
$400,000 to Catherine Cortez Masto, Deborah Ross, Maggie Hassan, and Katie 
McGinty.

That's how much people want Paul Ryan's warning about Bernie Sanders 
becoming chair of the budget committee to become true.

What you're doing for these candidates is yuuuge. It's game-changing for 
their campaigns. But there's still more to do, because we can do more than 
just take back the Senate. We have a chance to take back the House. It 
starts with helping candidates for Congress who are inspired by the 
political revolution.

So we're going to set an audacious goal that we don't know is possible to 
hit by tomorrow night's final FEC fundraising deadline – but it's one that 
is very important to try to reach.
