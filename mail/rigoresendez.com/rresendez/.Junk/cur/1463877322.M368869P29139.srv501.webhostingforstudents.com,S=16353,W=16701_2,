Rigoberto:

A massive haul of 475 pledged delegates will be up for grabs in California's 
June 7th election. We hope to win a big majority of those.

Since this is a people-powered campaign, we're asking for your help – in any 
of the following four ways – to do that!

1. Call some California voters now. 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/content/caphonebank/>  We're working to 
get as many Californians as possible registered to vote for Bernie before 
the voter registration deadline this Monday. Lots of voters – even those in 
other parties – are looking for the strongest candidate to beat Trump, and 
polls consistently show that that's Bernie.

Make calls to California now 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/content/caphonebank/>

2. Sign up to call California voters later. 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/get-california-registered?source=em160521b> 
Since California offers online voter registration, we'll be making calls 
right up through the deadline Monday evening. And every voter we can 
register, or re-register as a Democrat (or "no party preference"), is 
another potential vote for Bernie.

Sign up to make some calls later 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/get-california-registered?source=em160521b>

3. Share our California voter registration page on Facebook. 
<https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://berniesanders.com/california-register-vote/> 
If you have friends in California, tag them and ask them to spread the word 
too. Voter registration numbers are already trending up this year in the 
Golden State, so let's keep that momentum going!

Share on facebook and tag some friends 
<https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://berniesanders.com/california-register-vote/>

4. Contribute to support our campaign. 
<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/lets_go_bernie?refcode=em160521b-call-CA> 
We don't take money from super PACs, and have shocked the political 
establishment by showing that Americans just like you are eager and ready to 
fund a grassroots campaign that's not beholden to wealthy donors. Your 
donation will help keep our political revolution rolling all the way into 
the Democratic convention in July.

Contribute to support our campaign 
<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/lets_go_bernie?refcode=em160521b-call-CA>

We're staying in this fight all the way to the convention, because we know 
that Bernie is the strongest candidate to beat Trump in the fall. Every 
state we win and vote we earn strengthens our hand in delivering that 
message at the convention in Philadelphia, and signals to the political 
establishment that we will not accept the status quo of a corrupt political 
system that holds in place a rigged economy.

In solidarity,

Team Bernie
