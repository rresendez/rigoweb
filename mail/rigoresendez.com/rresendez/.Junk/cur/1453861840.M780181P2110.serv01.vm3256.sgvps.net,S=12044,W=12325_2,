It’s time to make calls for Bernie. Sign up for as many shifts as you can.


Rigoberto -

Something incredible happened this weekend: Bernie supporters in Texas 
signed up to host over one hundred phone banking parties across the state 
between now and our statewide day of action on Sunday.

That is what commitment looks like. We can make Bernie our next president if 
we all step up to do the hard work that wins elections.

With less than a week until the Iowa caucuses, and less than six weeks until 
March 1, this is the time to double down and work even harder for Bernie. We 
need you to sign up for a shift making phone calls to Texas voters – then 
sign up for as many more shifts as you can. Every call counts.

We're closing in on election day! Volunteer for Bernie!:

Bernie has a real shot at winning Iowa because millions of people just like 
you have donated, made phone calls, knocked on doors and organized in their 
communities. When he does, we have to be ready to turn momentum into victory 
in Texas.

We don’t have billionaires or super PACs on our side, so winning is going to 
take a lot of hard work by people just like us.

In solidarity,

- Team Bernie
