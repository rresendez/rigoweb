Sisters and Brothers -

Here is what I believe: the greed of the pharmaceutical and health care 
industries in this country is killing Americans. It is a national disgrace 
that, despite great gains made under the Affordable Care Act, 29 million of 
our neighbors are still without care.

That is why I am, frankly, a bit surprised that with less than three weeks 
to go before the Iowa caucuses, the Clinton campaign is attacking our belief 
that health care must be recognized as a right, not a privilege, for every 
man, woman and child in our country. We cannot wait to realize that goal, 
and the best way to get there is a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system.

Yesterday, one of Hillary Clinton's several super PACs took aim at us, 
saying our plan would "require tax increases on working families."

It would be a terrible setback for our shared values and for our movement to 
reform a corrupt political system if we lost because a super PAC scared 
voters into thinking our plan would take away people's coverage or cost them 
more money. Help make sure that doesn't happen.

 <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/m/24fb2a38/43b7f9e2/4516d90d/620f3818/1913155589/VEsH/>Please make another $5 contribution to put an end to these attacks and helpus win in Iowa.Under my plan, we will lower the cost of health care for the typical familyby nearly $5,000 a year. It is unfair to say simply how much more a programwill cost without letting people know we are doing away with the cost ofprivate insurance and that the middle class will be paying substantiallyless for health care under a single-payer system than Hillary Clinton'sprogram.Attacking the cost of the plan without acknowledging the bottom-line savingsis the way Republicans have attacked this idea for decades.Taking that approach in a Democratic primary undermines the hard work of somany who have fought to guarantee health care as a right in this country,and it hurts our prospects for achieving that goal in the near future.Fight back against the super PACs that have attacked our campaign, and helpdeliver a victory in Iowa for our political revolution.
