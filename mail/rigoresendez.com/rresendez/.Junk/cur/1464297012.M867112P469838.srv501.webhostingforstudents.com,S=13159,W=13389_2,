Rigoberto -

When I introduced a bill in the Senate that would slow the effects of 
climate change, I knew that I could count on Bernie Sanders to stand with me 
from the very first day.

Last year Bernie and I introduced the Keep It in the Ground Act, which would 
prevent new fracking, coal mining, and oil drilling on federal lands, as 
well as all new offshore oil drilling.

Bernie and I are committed to this fight because we know we can – and must – 
slow the pace of climate change. Scientists tell us that we need to keep 80 
percent of remaining fossil fuels in the ground to prevent the worst effects 
of climate change.
