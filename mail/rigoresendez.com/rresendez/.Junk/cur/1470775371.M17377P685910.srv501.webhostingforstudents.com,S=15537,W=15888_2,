Rigoberto:

Many of you already know that I've endorsed a candidate, Tim Canova, who is 
challenging the former head of the Democratic Party Debbie Wasserman Schultz 
in Florida.

This race is very important for Our Revolution because if we can win this 
tough fight in Florida, it will send a clear message about the power of our 
grassroots movement that will send shockwaves through the political and 
media establishments. The latest poll shows us within reach.

July 31 Poll
Debbie Wasserman Schultz: 46%
Tim Canova: 38%
Undecided: 16%

This is going to be close. Please chip in $15 to Tim Canova's campaign so 
that we can get as many voters to the polls as possible before the August 
30th primary. 
<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/canova-dws?refcode=em160809v2>

Much like in our campaign for president, Tim started off as a major underdog 
in this race, battling a well-known and well-established person who was the 
chairwoman of the Democratic Party.

He is running a tough campaign on the kind of progressive platform we need 
to see in this country: opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, backing free 
tuition at public colleges and universities, reforming a corrupt campaign 
finance system and raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Tim is on the 
side of working people and that's why we need to help him win.

Please make an urgent $15 contribution to Tim Canova's campaign today so his 
campaign can put it to use before the primary against Debbie Wasserman 
Schultz on August 30th. 
<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/canova-dws?refcode=em160809v2>

The recent emails leaked from Democratic Party staff showed that under 
Debbie Wasserman Schultz, DNC staff were not exactly fair and even-minded 
during the presidential primary. What was revealed wasn't much of a shock to 
us, because we knew all along that the establishment wasn't on our side.

But now that Debbie Wasserman Schultz has resigned we have the opportunity 
to transform the Democratic Party and open up its doors to working people 
and young people â€” people who want real change. Democrats must make it 
crystal clear that their party is prepared to take on Wall Street and the 
powerful corporate interests whose greed is doing so much harm to our 
country. We must stand with Americans who are working longer hours for lower 
wages, the uninsured, students leaving school deeply in debt and all those 
worried about climate change.

I believe Tim Canova is the kind of candidate whose policies will move the 
Democratic Party and our country in that direction. Electing Tim will send a 
strong message to the Democratic establishment about what this party should 
stand for. That's why I'm asking you today to help send him to Congress:

Can you rush a $15 contribution to Tim Canova's campaign today before this 
critical primary against Debbie Wasserman Schultz on August 30th? 
<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/canova-dws?refcode=em160809v2>

This race has been an uphill battle from the very beginning, but the latest 
poll has us very close. I am confident we can win this fight with your 
support.

Thank you for being a part of Our Revolution.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders
