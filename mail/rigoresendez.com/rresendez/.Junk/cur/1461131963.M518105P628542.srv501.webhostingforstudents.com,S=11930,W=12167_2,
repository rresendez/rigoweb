Rigoberto -

When we started this campaign, we were down almost 50 points in New York — 
the state where Hillary Clinton was elected to two terms in the U.S. Senate.

We didn’t get the victory we had hoped for this evening, but what’s 
important is that it looks like we’re going to win a lot more delegates in 
New York than any state that voted or caucused before tonight.

So what does that mean? Five important states vote one week from tonight, 
with more delegates at stake than Hillary Clinton led by coming into 
tonight. And if we do well next Tuesday, we remain in a position to take the 
pledged delegate lead when almost 700 delegates are up for grabs on June 7.

As you read this, thousands of supporters are responding to tonight’s 
results with contributions because they believe we can win. I need to know 
if I can count on you to add yours.
