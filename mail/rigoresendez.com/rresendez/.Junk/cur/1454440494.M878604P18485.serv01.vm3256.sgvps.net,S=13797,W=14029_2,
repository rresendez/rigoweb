Rigoberto -

When I think about what happened last night, I think the people of Iowa sent 
a very profound message to the political establishment, to the economic 
establishment, and to the media establishment.

And what that message said was that given the enormous crises facing our 
country, it is too late for establishment politics and economics in this 
country. That we can no longer continue to have a corrupt campaign finance 
system. And that this moment in our history requires us to think big.

I am overwhelmed and moved by the fact that millions of people throughout 
the country made last night possible, and that we were able to do it without 
begging millionaires for money, and without a super PAC. We are going to win 
this campaign or we are going to lose, but we are going to do it together. 
And we can’t let up now.

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/profound-message?refcode=em160202full>The New Hampshire primary is in just one week and your $5 contribution toour campaign today will make all the difference.If last night proved anything, it’s that every single contribution mattersand every volunteer shift can swing an election.In this campaign, and in the White House, I cannot do it alone. No candidateand no president will be able to bring about the changes working familiesand the middle class of this country deserve without a major grassrootsmovement. The powers that be, Wall Street with their endless supply ofmoney, corporate America, the large campaign donors are so powerful nopresident can do what has to be done by him or herself.This moment requires a political revolution that has millions of peoplecoming together, including those who have given up on the political process,saying they have had ENOUGH of the billionaire class buying our democracy.That is what your $5 contribution will go towards building, and why it’s soimportant you make one more today.
