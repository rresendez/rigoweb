Rigoberto -

Moments ago the news networks declared us the winner of yet another state - 
our 18th of the primary season: Indiana.

For the past several weeks, the corporate media has counted us out of this 
election. The political and financial establishment of this country have 
been vocal in their desire for us to go away. To get in line.

Today, the voters had another idea.

Every victory we earn is extraordinarily important for our political 
revolution. Not just because of the delegates we earn, but because each win 
and all the work that goes into that effort sends an unmistakable message to 
the establishment of this country that we will never stop fighting for the 
values we share. I say we keep fighting. Are you with me?

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/indiana-victory?refcode=em160503>Adding one more $15 contribution to our campaign sends a powerful messagethat we will fight for the values we share all the way through theDemocratic convention and beyond.The next states up are West Virginia, Kentucky and Oregon. They are allplaces we have a chance to do very well. I am in this fight through theDemocratic convention.
