Rigoberto:

Thanks to all of your hard work in our campaign this past year we have 
transformed American politics. On issue after issue — making college 
affordable, progressive taxation, climate change, trade and many others — 
more and more Americans are agreeing with us. People are ready to take on 
the 1 percent.

During our campaign we assembled a movement of millions of people ready to 
fight for the country we know we can become. Election days come and go, but 
the struggle for economic, social, racial and environmental justice must 
continue. We have the guts and the energy to take on the special interests, 
win critical battles on the most important issues of our time, and redefine 
what's possible in this country. Now it's time for all of us to get to work. 
Please be part of our new organization, Our Revolution.

On August 24 at 9pm ET / 6pm PT, I will address our national network of 
volunteers live at more than 2,000 organizing meetings across the country. 
Please attend one of those meetings in your area so you can get involved in 
the next steps for Our Revolution:
