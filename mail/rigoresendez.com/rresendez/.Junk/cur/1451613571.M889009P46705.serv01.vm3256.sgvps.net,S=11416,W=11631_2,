Rigoberto -

Time is running out, so I need to take a moment to share with you why these 
emails are so important to our campaign.

Yesterday afternoon we learned that Hillary Clinton has most likely raised 
well over $100 million since she started her campaign. You’ve probably seen 
the articles about their high-powered fundraising events with the country’s 
financial elite that sometimes pull in millions of dollars in a single 
night!

But you know Bernie. He does not go around asking millionaires and 
billionaires for money at those kind of events — it is emails like this that 
fund our campaign. So when you see our poll numbers rise and the size of our 
organization continuously grow, it is these requests that make that result 
possible.

The clock is ticking, and I have to ask once more before midnight:
