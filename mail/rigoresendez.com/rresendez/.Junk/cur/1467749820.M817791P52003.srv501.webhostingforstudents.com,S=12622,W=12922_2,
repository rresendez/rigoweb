Friday is important, Rigoberto. That's our next chance before the Democratic 
convention to make sure that preventing the disastrous TPP trade agreement 
from getting a vote in Congress is part of the Democratic Party platform.

We're going to work hard for the Democratic Party to forcefully reject this 
job-killing trade deal, but we need your help to do so.

Here's the amendment we are offering when the platform committee meets again 
on July 8 in Orlando, Florida. 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/tpp-dnc?source=em160705> We still need 
your signature to endorse this amendment. Add yours now before it's too 
late.

Our Amendment to the Democratic Party platform
"It is the policy of the Democratic Party that the Trans-Pacific Partnership 
must not get a vote in this Congress or in future sessions of Congress."ADD YOUR NAME 
 <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/tpp-dnc?source=em160705> Â»

We're fighting to include this amendment to the Democratic Party platform 
because we want to prevent the outsourcing of jobs, protect the environment, 
stop pharmaceutical companies from increasing the price of prescription 
drugs, preserve our democracy, and respect human rights.

If we succeed, we will be in a very strong position to stop a vote on the 
TPP and to fundamentally rewrite our trade agreements to end the race to the 
bottom and lift up the living standards of people in this country and 
throughout the world.

Our next shot at winning this is at the platform meeting in Orlando on 
Friday.

 <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/tpp-dnc?source=em160705> Winning this 
fight starts with adding your name to say you want the Democratic Party 
platform to oppose a vote on the disastrous TPP. Click here to add your name 
now.

Thanks for speaking out about this critical issue.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver
