Rigoberto -

This is what a political revolution looks like: working Americans coming 
together to say they have had ENOUGH of the influence of a billionaire class 
buying elections to enrich themselves while everyone else gets poorer.

Take a look at the response from earlier today to Bernie’s email — 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/m/24fb28d1/43b7f9e2/49bda3af/620d6877/3236154832/VEsH/> 
all real contributions from people helping us reach our deadline goal.

And to do that, we need to bringmillions of people together to stand up loudly and clearly to say “thiscountry belongs to all of us, not just a wealthy few.”That’s the message we can send after this FEC deadline, but there are stilla few hours left to go until we close the books and report our numbers.
