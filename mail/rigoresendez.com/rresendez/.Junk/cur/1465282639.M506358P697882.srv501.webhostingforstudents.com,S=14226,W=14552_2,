Rigoberto –

Tuesday marks the largest set of primaries and caucuses in the Democratic 
nomination process with six states voting for president and 694 pledged 
delegates up for grabs.

Pundits and the political press want to call this race early before every 
last person votes. That threatens to suppress voter turnout in New Jersey, 
California, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and New Mexico. But we’re 
not going to let that happen.

On Tuesday, we’re going to defy the pundits once more and reach for the kind 
of high voter turnout that will again shock the establishment. Help reach 
Bernie voters:

To get logged on and start making calls, just head on over to our California 
phonebanking page <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/content/caphonebank> .

I'm ready to call California voters! 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/content/caphonebank>

Throughout this race, we’ve been sending the establishment a message they 
can’t ignore: we won’t settle for the status quo. We won’t settle for a 
rigged economy held in place by a corrupt system of campaign finance. We won’t 
settle for a fossil fuel industry hell-bent on harming our planet to pad 
their profits. We won’t settle for a health system that doesn’t cover 
everyone.

Let’s make our voices heard loud and clear once more in the six states 
voting Tuesday. Please make calls to get out the vote for Bernie in 
California. <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/content/caphonebank>

In California, a high voter turnout won’t just mean a victory for our 
movement. With large numbers of young people hitting the polls, we’ll boost 
so many Democrats in major primaries that right-wing Republicans will be 
locked out of general election ballots for some of the most important House 
and Senate races of the fall.

Members of the media and political establishment may have anointed Secretary 
Clinton from day one, but we know that this race is going to carry on until 
the delegates cast ballots at the convention in Philadelphia.

We should let the voters decide who they want the Democratic nominee to be 
rather than having the media decide for them. I am asking you to continue to 
stand with Bernie in pushing for the political revolution.

Please make calls to get out the vote for Bernie in California.

Jeff Weaver
