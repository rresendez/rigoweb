Rigoberto -

Washington, D.C. votes today in the final contest of the Democratic primary. 
Our staff and volunteers are working hard for every vote and every delegate 
in the District of Columbia because each is an important declaration of 
support for the values we share, and the issues that have powered our 
campaign.

When we started this campaign, I told you that I was running not to oppose 
any man or woman, but to propose new and far-reaching policies to deal with 
the crises of our time. And for the past fourteen months, through the entire 
primary process, we’ve sent the establishment a message they can’t ignore: 
we won’t settle for the status quo.

After today, the voting is done, but our political revolution continues.

I want to talk to you directly on Thursday night about what’s next for our 
campaign in a live, online video address at 8:30 p.m. EDT / 5:30 p.m. PDT. I 
hope that you will join:

 <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/live?source=em160614> Sign up to RSVP 
to watch my live, online video message on Thursday night and we’ll send you 
a text message or email shortly before the event begins.

This campaign is about more than Bernie Sanders. It is about all of us 
together. It is about millions of people from coast to coast knowing that we 
can do much better as a nation.

I hope that you will join the conversation on Thursday night and ask your 
friends to do the same.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders
