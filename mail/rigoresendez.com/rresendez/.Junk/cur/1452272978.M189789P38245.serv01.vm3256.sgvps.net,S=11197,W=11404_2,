Rigoberto -

Donald Trump and I finally agree on something. He wants to run against me. I 
want to run against him.

The American people will not support a candidate trying to divide us up by 
where we came from. They will not support a candidate who does not favor 
raising the minimum wage and who thinks wages in this country are too high. 
They will not support a candidate who thinks climate change is a hoax 
invented by the Chinese. And they will not support a candidate who wants to 
give huge tax breaks to billionaires like himself.

It would be an extraordinary campaign, and one I am confident that we will 
win.
