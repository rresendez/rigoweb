Dear Rigoberto,

Thanks in no small part to your efforts on the phones last weekend, voter 
registration numbers in California saw a big surge right before the May 23rd 
deadline.

We also learned this week that – according to a poll from the Public Policy 
Institute of California – we're now within striking distance of a victory in 
California on June 7th.

Our in-state staff and volunteers are working incredibly hard for the win, 
but they need your help. This is the most critical weekend for us to get on 
the phones and identify Bernie supporters, so that next week our ground 
teams know which doors to knock and which voters to persuade. Can you pitch 
in an hour or two of your time this weekend to help Bernie win California?

Yes, I'll make some calls this weekend 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/call-california-for-bernie?source=em160528>

If you've never called voters for Bernie before, don't worry – it's not 
hard. You just need a computer or a tablet, and a phone. We provide a simple 
script for you to follow, and dedicated volunteers are standing by on 
livechat to assist if you run into any problems.

Thanks to your support, we've won 21 primaries and caucuses so far this 
year – a result that no one would have predicted when we launched this 
campaign just over a year ago. California represents the biggest prize of 
all, with 475 pledged delegates at stake, and a victory there would send a 
gigantic signal to the political establishment that our movement has real 
staying power.

With your help, we'll keep this political revolution going all the way to 
the convention in Philadelphia. So we hope you can help out this weekend and 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/call-california-for-bernie?source=em160528> 
sign up to call for an hour or two.

In solidarity,

Team Bernie



I can't volunteer, but I'll contribute
