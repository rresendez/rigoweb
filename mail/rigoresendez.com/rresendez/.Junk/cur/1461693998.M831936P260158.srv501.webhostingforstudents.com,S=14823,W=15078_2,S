Rigoberto -

Over the past few days, Hillary Clinton’s campaign and some of its top 
supporters have launched an odd new line of attack against people like you 
who stand with Bernie. They are saying that by continuing to campaign and 
fight for every vote, for every delegate, that we are helping Donald Trump.

They’ve used language reserved for traitors to our country, saying we are 
"giving aid and comfort" to Trump. They are emailing supporters with the 
subject line "What Trump loves about Bernie."

Let me be clear, there is one candidate in this Democratic primary who 
Donald Trump said would make a "great president," and it’s not Bernie 
Sanders.

Bernie is going to fight through the narrow path we have to the nomination 
because there is also only one candidate who believes health care should be 
a right for everyone in this country, that kids of all backgrounds should be 
able to go to college without crushing debt, and that we cannot transform a 
corrupt system by taking its money.

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/values-we-share?refcode=em160426-full>Can Bernie count on you to contribute $15 to our campaign right now as a wayof saying you are still with Bernie Sanders and believe that every vote andevery delegate is an important declaration of support for the values weshare?(Pictured below: Donald Trump and the one candidate in this race he saidwould make a "great president.") <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/values-we-share?refcode=em160426-full>Here’s the truth: no matter what the Clinton campaign says, there is onecandidate in this race Donald Trump said would make a great president, andanother that he would never want to face in November.And that’s because poll after poll after poll shows that he wouldn’t stand achance against our political revolution.So we are going to keep fighting hard for every vote and for every delegate.Not just because that’s the only way to win this nomination, but because webelieve the power of our progressive agenda would energize the kind of highvoter turnout needed to stop Trump. That’s why we have to ask: <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/values-we-share?refcode=em160426-full> Can Bernie count on you to contribute $15 to our campaign right nowas a way of saying you are still with Bernie Sanders and believe that everyvote and every delegate is an important declaration of support for thevalues we share?People are voting in five primaries today.
