 <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/tpp-dnc?source=em160629-v2-full> Add 
your name to tell the DNC Platform Committee to make sure the party's 
platform includes our amendment to prevent the disastrous TPP trade deal 
from ever coming up for a vote.

  _____

Rigoberto -

Our struggle over the Democratic Party platform is about making clear that 
we intend to create an economy that works for all of us, and not just the 
wealthy and powerful.

Now, we’ve made some great progress to include a number of very important 
initiatives that we have been fighting to achieve during this campaign. 
Major accomplishments that will begin to move this country in the right 
direction like breaking up huge financial institutions and enacting a 21st 
Century Glass-Steagall Act, a historic expansion of Social Security, taking 
on the greed of the pharmaceutical companies, banning private prisons, 
eliminating super PACs, and moving to public financing of elections, and 
more.

But more needs to be done. And the most important issue is to make it clear 
that we must defeat the disastrous Trans-Pacific Partnership.

So I want you to mark July 8 on your calendar – that is the next meeting of 
the Democratic Platform Committee in Orlando, Florida. Between now and then, 
our job is to do everything we can to rally support for an amendment to the 
platform in strong opposition to the TPP.

And I believe that if we all make our voices heard between now and then, we 
can win this fight:

 <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/tpp-dnc?source=em160629-v2-full> Add 
your name to tell the DNC Platform Committee to make sure the party's 
platform includes our amendment to prevent the disastrous TPP trade deal 
from ever coming up for a vote.

Let me be clear: this is not about embarrassing anyone. This is about 
preventing the outsourcing of jobs, protecting the environment, stopping 
pharmaceutical companies from increasing the price of prescription drugs, 
preserving our democracy, and respecting human rights.

This is about you and millions of other people making our voices heard that 
we need to create a Democratic Party which fights for working families and 
not wealthy campaign contributors.

If we succeed, we will be in a very strong position to stop a vote on the 
TPP and to fundamentally rewrite our trade agreements to end the race to the 
bottom and lift up the living standards of people in this country and 
throughout the world.

That is the work of our political revolution, and you are the 
revolutionaries. And I believe that if we continue to stand together and 
fight for the values we share, we will transform the Democratic Party.

But that starts with bringing the entire party together and speaking with 
one voice in opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership:

 <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/tpp-dnc?source=em160629-v2-full> Add 
your name to tell the DNC Platform Committee to make sure the party's 
platform includes our amendment to prevent the disastrous TPP trade deal 
from ever coming up for a vote.

It is imperative that this platform be not only the most progressive in the 
history of the Democratic Party, but that it includes a set of policies that 
will be fought for and implemented by Democratic elected officials.

I am going to do everything I can to rally support in Orlando for our 
amendment opposing the TPP. But I want to be clear that if we fail there we 
are going to take this fight to the floor of the Democratic Party convention 
in Philadelphia next month.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders
