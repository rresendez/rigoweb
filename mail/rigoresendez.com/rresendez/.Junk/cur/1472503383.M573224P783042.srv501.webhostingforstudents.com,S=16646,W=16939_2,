Rigoberto,

As a result of your activism, our political revolution is responsible for 
the most progressive Democratic platform in the history of our country. We 
were victorious in making it a clear priority of the Democratic Party to 
fight for a $15 an hour federal minimum wage, expand Social Security, 
abolish the death penalty, put a price on carbon, enact major criminal 
justice reforms, end for-profit prisons and detention facilities, break up 
too-big-to-fail banks and create a 21st century Glass-Steagall Act, and so 
much more.

And just the other day, the Republican leadership in the Senate announced 
that the TPP would not be coming to the floor this year. Another major 
victory.

All of that is the direct result of the grassroots activism that you, and 
millions of others, engaged in over the last 16 months. Now, we must 
continue our efforts by electing progressive Democrats up and down the 
ballot so that the policies we have fought for can advance and become law.

For the future of our country, and our progressive agenda, it is imperative 
that Democrats regain control of the Senate. My guess is that will all come 
down to which party wins three or four hotly contested races in states like 
Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Ohio and Nevada.

The Koch brothers know this. That is why they are spending tens of millions 
of dollars to defeat these four candidates for Senate.

And that's why I'm asking you to support them: Katie McGinty in 
Pennsylvania, Maggie Hassan in New Hampshire, Ted Strickland in Ohio, and 
Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada. If these four Democrats win the tight 
elections they are currently in, the Democrats will almost certainly take 
control of the Senate.

And what a world of difference that will make: real campaign finance reform, 
raising the minimum wage, making public colleges and universities tuition 
free, addressing the planetary crisis of climate change, progressive 
taxation, reforming our broken criminal justice system, comprehensive 
immigration reform and many other important issues.

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/us_senate_slate?refcode=em160829-full>Split a $15 contribution to help Katie McGinty, Maggie Hassan, TedStrickland, and Catherine Cortez Masto become senators and take back aprogressive majority in the Senate.I want to be clear: It is very important that our movement holds publicofficials accountable. The Democratic Party passed an extremely progressiveagenda at the convention. Our job is to make sure that platform isimplemented. That will not happen without Democratic control of the Senate.*	Katie McGinty was one of the first candidates to endorse a $15 minimumwage.*	Maggie Hassan, who is a strong supporter of campaign finance reform,increased transparency and disclosure of political contributions as Governorof New Hampshire.*	Ted Strickland is a fighter for Ohio’s working families who opposes theTPP and believes that we need to completely change the way we negotiatetrade deals.*	Catherine Cortez Masto is committed to protecting the environment andknows it’s long past time that we ensure equal pay for women.Perhaps the most important reason to win a progressive majority in theSenate is because we must support nominees for the Supreme Court who willvote to overturn Citizens United.It is so important we do everything we can to help these four candidates –Katie McGinty in Pennsylvania, Maggie Hassan in New Hampshire, TedStrickland in Ohio, and Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada – win theirelections in November. <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/us_senate_slate?refcode=em160829-full> Your contribution of $15 will help each of these candidates forSenate win.
