Rigoberto -

No president, not Bernie Sanders, not the greatest president you could 
possibly imagine, can take on the billionaire class alone. And that’s 
because change never happens from the top down, it always occurs from the 
bottom up.

That’s why today I am announcing my support for eight progressive state 
legislative candidates who embody the spirit of our political revolution.

Today, they are state representatives running for re-election or challenging 
to win their first race. Tomorrow, they’ll be progressives running for 
Congress and maybe even the presidency. And in 2020, they’ll help determine 
how congressional districts are drawn for the remainder of the next decade — 
a key to Democrats taking back and holding the House of Representatives for 
the decade to come.

It’s up to us to transform the future of the Democratic Party, and that’s 
why I am proud to ask:

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/bernie-for-state-candidates?refcode=em160524-v1>Can I count on you to split a $15 contribution to our campaign and a greatslate of progressive state legislative candidates as a way of saying we aregoing to fight to transform our country, and the Democratic Party, from thebottom up?We are going to keep fighting for every vote, every delegate, and everystate, but this moment also requires helping progressives who are fightingfor change at the local level. That is the political revolution, and that’swhy splitting your contribution between our campaign and this great slate oflocal candidates is so important.In solidarity,Bernie SandersContribute<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/bernie-for-state-candidates?refcode=em160524-v1>Paid for by Bernie 2016  <https://s.bsd.net/bernie16/main/page/-/website/billionaires.png>PO Box 905 - Burlington VT 05402 United States - (855) 4-BERNIEThis email was sent to rresendez@rigoresendez.com.
