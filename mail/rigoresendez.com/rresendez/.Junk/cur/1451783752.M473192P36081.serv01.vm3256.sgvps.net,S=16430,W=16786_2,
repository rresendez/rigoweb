Together we have done something unprecedented: More than 2.5 million 
contributions to our campaign totaling $73 million in the last year. 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/m/24fb2b34/43b7f9e2/464cf6b4/620ff2c9/2651882386/VEsH/p/eyJKU1ZhU1ZBbEpRPT0iOiI3ODUzOSJ9/> 
Now take the next step and commit to talking to voters at a local volunteer 
event in your community.

Dear Rigoberto,

Today we are very proud to announce some extraordinary news: our supporters 
have made 2.5 million contributions to our campaign totaling $73 million, 
including $33 million in the last three months.

You have donated to our campaign, and so I want to immediately say THANK 
YOU. I know we have asked a lot recently, and your support means so much to 
what we are doing.

There were very few people in the world who would have believed you one year 
ago if you said that Bernie Sanders' supporters would raise $73 million by 
the end of the year for our presidential campaign. And yet here we are.

More important than how much money we've raised is how we have raised these 
funds. Incredibly, the vast majority of all the money we have raised comes 
from small-dollar contributions. You won't see that from our opponent. I 
don't go around asking a handful of millionaires and billionaires for big 
checks and call it a day.

The truth is our campaign finance system is nothing short of a national 
disgrace. Elections should be determined by the power of good ideas, not who 
can hustle the most money from the rich and powerful.

Real change comes when large numbers of Americans get involved in the 
democratic process. We have shown that is possible in terms of competing 
financially against the interests of the billionaire class. And now it is 
time to show that we can organize in our communities too.

With the first people voting for our next president in less than a month, we 
have an obligation right now to do all we can to bring as many people into 
the democratic process as we can. We have a real path toward victory if you 
can commit to talking to voters at local volunteer event in your community. 
Here's information for events happening near you:

Our supporters are organizing thousands more events in communities all 
across the country as well. You can

find those here.

When we talk about a "political revolution," we are not just talking about 
tinkering around the edges of American society. We are talking about 
transforming our country in many respects — the economy, health care, 
education, the environment, criminal justice, immigration and many other 
areas.

Powered by more than 2.5 million contributions from 1 million people 
donating less than $30 a piece, we have shown that our political revolution 
should not be underestimated.

I am excited to see what comes next. Thank you for all of your support.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders
