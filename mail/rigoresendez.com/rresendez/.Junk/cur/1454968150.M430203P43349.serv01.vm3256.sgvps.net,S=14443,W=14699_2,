Rigoberto -

I want you to imagine eight years from now:

The minimum wage is a living wage and students are graduating college 
without the crushing debt stifling their ability to pursue the career of 
their dreams.

Health care is recognized as a right for every man, woman, and child, and 
the United States is leading the world in fighting climate change.

There is no bank that is too big to fail, no banker too powerful to jail, 
and we’ve leveled the playing field so that the billionaire class is no 
longer able to buy and sell our candidates and elections.

When that happens, they will say it all started tomorrow night in New 
Hampshire where we have overcome not just a forty point deficit in the 
polls, but the sneers of the corporate media and opposition from political 
elites and billionaire super PACs.

But we still have work to do. More than 3.5 million individual 
contributions, including yours, have helped power us to a slight lead in New 
Hampshire. But if we’re going to hold on and win tomorrow night, we 
desperately need you to add one more before midnight.
