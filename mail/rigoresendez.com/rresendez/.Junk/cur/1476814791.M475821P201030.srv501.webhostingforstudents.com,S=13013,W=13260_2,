Rigoberto,

Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan issued a very dire warning this 
week. You need to see it:

  _____

"If we lose the Senate, do you know who becomes chair of the Senate Budget 
Committee? A guy named Bernie Sanders. You ever heard of him?"

  _____

You heard the man. Let's take back the Senate.

Four of our best opportunities to take back the Senate are in Nevada, New 
Hampshire, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. Each race is incredibly close. 
But if the Democratic nominees win, we will have a far more progressive 
Senate â€“ and a majority to enact our progressive agenda.

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/progressive-senate?refcode=em161018-full-ns>The final FEC fundraising deadline of the campaign is Wednesday at midnight.Split a $15 contribution now between Catherine Cortez Masto, Maggie Hassan,Deborah Ross, and Katie McGinty before tomorrow's deadline.How close are these races? The latest poll averages have Deborah Ross downby just two points in North Carolina. In Nevada, Catherine Cortez Masto isup by two. Maggie Hassan is down by a little more than two points in NewHampshire. And in the tightest race of all, Katie McGinty is up by less thana half percent in Pennsylvania.Four Senate seats we need for a majority. Four dedicated leaders who couldserve with Bernie Sanders. At most a two percent difference in the polls forevery race.Your contributions can be the difference between victory and defeat in eachof these elections. Small-dollar contributions from emails like this canpush Catherine Cortez Masto, Deborah Ross, Maggie Hassan, and Katie McGintyover the top on election day.With tomorrow's FINAL fundraising deadline for the FEC, the time is now forus to step up and help take back a Senate majority. <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/progressive-senate?refcode=em161018-full-ns> Split a $15 contribution between the campaigns of CatherineCortez Masto, Deborah Ross, Maggie Hassan, and Katie McGinty beforetomorrow's deadline.You can make the difference in this election to take back a Senate majority.Thank you.In solidarity,Jeff WeaverTeam BernieCONTRIBUTE<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/progressive-senate?refcode=em161018-full-ns>Paid for by Friends of Bernie SandersPO BOX 391, Burlington, VT 05402This email was sent to rresendez@rigoresendez.com.
