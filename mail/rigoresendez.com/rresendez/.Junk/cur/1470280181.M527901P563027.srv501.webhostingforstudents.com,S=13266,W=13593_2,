Rigoberto,

Election days come and go, but the struggle for economic, social, racial and 
environmental justice continues. Together, we built something special and 
unprecedented through our presidential campaign. Now, we are going to take 
the next steps for our political revolution.

We are building a new organization called Our Revolution. Our goal will be 
the same as in our campaign: we must work to transform American society by 
making our political and economic systems work for all of us, not just the 1 
percent.

Can you make a $15 contribution to Our Revolution so that we can continue 
our critical work to take back our country from the billionaire class? Make 
your contribution here. 
<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/transform-america?refcode=em160803>

On the very first day of our campaign, I wrote to my supporters and said, 
"This campaign is not about Bernie Sanders. It's about a grassroots movement 
of Americans standing up and saying: 'Enough is enough. This country and our 
government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.'"

That is as true today as it was then. That is why Our Revolution will focus 
on three distinct areas of work:

1.	Revitalizing American democracy by bringing millions of working people 
and young people into the political system.
2.	Empowering the next generation of progressive leaders by inspiring, 
recruiting and supporting progressive candidates across the entire spectrum 
of government - from school board to the U.S. Senate.
3.	Doing what the corporate media does not do: elevating political 
consciousness by educating the public about the most pressing issues 
confronting our nation and the bold solutions needed to address them.

Together we can revitalize our democracy, empower new progressive leaders, 
and educate the public about the critical issues facing our country. To get 
started, I need your help, Rigoberto. Will you join me?

Add a $15 contribution to Our Revolution and be one of the first to join 
this next phase of our movement. 
<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/transform-america?refcode=em160803>

We have a lot to do together, Rigoberto, and I'm glad you're with me.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders
