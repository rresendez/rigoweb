Rigoberto -

We just got word that we won our 19th state, taking the majority of the 
delegates in today's primary in West Virginia.

Every vote we earn and every delegate we secure sends an unmistakable 
message about the values we share, the country's support for the ideas of 
our campaign, and a rejection of Donald Trump and his values.

Now we're on to two more primaries next week in Kentucky and Oregon, where 
we also hope to do very well. So let's keep going.

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/west-virginia-win?refcode=em160510>Add one more $15 contribution to our campaign and we can win Kentucky andOregon next week and send a powerful message that we'll fight for our valuesall the way up to the Democratic convention.There is nothing I would like more than to take on and defeat Donald Trump,someone who must never become president of this country. But I believe thatit is not enough to just reject Trump – this is an opportunity to define aprogressive vision for America. Voters agree: just today, three new pollsshowed that we are the best campaign to defeat Trump.We fully acknowledge we have an uphill climb ahead of us, but we’re used tothat. We have been fighting uphill from the day this campaign began, and we’re going to stay in the race until the last vote is cast. And with yourhelp, I hope to take on Trump, too. Thank you for standing with me. <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/west-virginia-win?refcode=em160510> Add another $15 contribution to our campaign now.In solidarity,Bernie SandersContribute<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/west-virginia-win?refcode=em160510>Paid for by Bernie 2016  <https://s.bsd.net/bernie16/main/page/-/website/billionaires.png>PO Box 905 - Burlington VT 05402 United States - (855) 4-BERNIEThis email was sent to rresendez@rigoresendez.com.
