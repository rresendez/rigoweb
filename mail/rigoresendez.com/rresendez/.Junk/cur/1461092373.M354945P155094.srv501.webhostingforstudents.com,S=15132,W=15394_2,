Here’s the truth, Rigoberto: since the start of this campaign, a majority of 
the money raised by the Clinton campaign has come from people giving the 
maximum amount allowable.

On our side, something happened that no one ever expected. Millions of 
people came together giving an average of $27 at a time to our campaign, and 
we actually started raising more money than the most inevitable candidate 
ever. Not even Wall Street could keep up!

So, as we got closer to the primaries and caucuses, the Clinton campaign had 
a problem – how were they going to deal with this? They responded as you’d 
think: they asked the richest of the rich (think Walmart’s Alice Walton) to 
contribute $353,400 to something called the "Hillary Victory Fund," and the 
majority of the money the "Fund" has spent has gone to support the Clinton 
campaign in the form of cash transfers, advertising, and efforts to attract 
new donors. Tens of millions of dollars put to use to try to defeat us in a 
primary.

It’s an arrangement that stretches campaign finance rules to the breaking 
point or beyond. But it’s what we are facing in New York tonight and in five 
states next week. And that’s why we have to ask:

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/what-our-campaign-is-up-against?refcode=em160419-full>You have made a $15 contribution to this campaign previously. It’s one ofthe reasons we’ve done so well. But now we have to fight back against this"Victory Fund" spending, and that’s why Bernie needs you to match that $15donation today. You can do that here.What makes this worse, honestly, is the way the Clinton campaign has toutedthe "Hillary Victory Fund" as a tool to benefit the DNC and state parties.We’ve heard it on television, in debates, and they’ve used it as a line ofattack against Bernie repeatedly. But now, that turns out not to be true.Because of reporting timelines, it wasn’t even clear until this week justhow much of the money they’ve been claiming is going to elect Democrats hasactually been spent trying to defeat us. And we won’t know again for anotherthree months how much more of that money they're going to try and use tobeat us in New York, five states next week, and the huge delegate haul onJune 7.That’s why we have to ask: <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/what-our-campaign-is-up-against?refcode=em160419-full> You have made a $15 contribution to this campaignpreviously.
