I wanted to make sure you had a chance to see the email Bernie sent 
yesterday, Rigoberto.

In just four days we’re going to close the books on the final fundraising 
deadline of the Democratic primary. We’re down just two points in California 
and a victory there would send an unmistakable message of support for our 
campaign ahead of the Democratic convention. Russ Feingold also has a 
fundraising deadline on the same day and Bernie is very committed to helping 
him win as well. That’s why we have to ask:

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/feingold-for-senate?refcode=em160527>Split a $15 contribution to Bernie 2016 and Russ Feingold’s campaign and we’re going to win California, and elect a great progressive to the U.S. Senatein Wisconsin.From the White House to the Congress and state capitals across the country,we need to elect leaders who share our values.

Can you join me in helping elect Russ Feingold? <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/feingold-for-senate?refcode=em160527> Split a $15 contribution between Bernie 2016 and Russ Feingold beforeour final FEC fundraising deadline of the primary to show that we can electsenators who don't need big money in politics.Let me tell you a little about what made Russ so effective when he was inthe Senate. Russ was the sole vote in the Senate against the USA Patriot Actin 2001. He opposed the war in Iraq, he fought disastrous trade deals andworked to reform our health care system. Russ was also an author of theMcCain-Feingold Act to reform our corrupt campaign finance system.Meanwhile, his Republican opponent credits a Koch brothers organization withinspiring him to run for Senate in the first place. Ron Johnson wants toprivatize veterans' health care and even said he supports Donald Trump asthe Republican nominee.Russ has already faced a huge influx of big money trying to keep him out ofthe Senate. In fact, the Koch brothers had their ads from a $2 millioncampaign against Russ taken off the air by TV stations when they were notedto be "false, misleading, and deceptive."That won't be the last time the Koch brothers try to take out Russ.
