Rigoberto -

Our campaign is at a moment of truth: the Iowa caucus is just three days 
away, we’re neck and neck with Hillary Clinton, and just yesterday one of 
her super PACs went on television trying to tip the balance of the race in 
her favor.

I want to be very clear with you about something: You are our movement. We 
don’t have any billionaires waiting in the wings with bags of cash, no 
saviors from the oligarchy are going to swoop in and save the day. This 
campaign is led by ordinary people who have had enough of the influence of 
the billionaire class in this country. It’s led by you.

So I have to ask you directly: Can I count on you to contribute $5 one more 
time to our campaign before midnight tonight? Today is the last day to 
contribute and have it go towards our campaign in Iowa. You can do that 
here:
