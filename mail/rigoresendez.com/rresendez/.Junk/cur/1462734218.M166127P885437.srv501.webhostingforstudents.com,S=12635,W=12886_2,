Take a look at this, Rigoberto.

July 9, 2015 - shortly after Jeb Bush announced that his super PAC had 
raised $114 million.

"We still don't know the details of who gave all that money, but we believe 
some of it came in the form of million - and even multimillion dollar checks 
from a small handful of right-wing mega-donors." - Clinton campaign manager 
Robby Mook

May 5, 2016 - shortly after Donald Trump becomes the presumptive Republican 
Party nominee.

"Hillary Clinton's supporters in recent days have been making a furious 
round of calls to top Bush family donors to try to convince them that she 
represents their values better than Donald Trump." - Politico

Bernie Sanders believes that you cannot change a corrupt system by taking 
its money.

We are funding our campaign a different way. And every vote we earn, 
delegate we claim, and state we win from now until the convention is only 
because people have come together to say they are SICK AND TIRED of the 
billionaire class buying our candidates and elections. And that's why we 
ask:

Theparty that will lead the way to tuition-free college so kids can graduatewithout crushing debt.
