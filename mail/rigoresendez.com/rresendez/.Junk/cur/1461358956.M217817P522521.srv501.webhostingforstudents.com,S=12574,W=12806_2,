Rigoberto,

It's game time. On Tuesday, five states go to the polls: Connecticut, 
Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island, and Pennsylvania. Combined, there are 384 
pledged delegates at stake. Our goal is simple: win as many as possible. Our 
plan to do it: talk to as many voters as possible.

That's where you come in. Starting tomorrow and going through Monday, we're 
doing something huge: calling 3.5 MILLION voters. It's a tall order – but so 
is a political revolution to take back our democracy.

Yes, I'll get on the phones for Bernie this weekend
