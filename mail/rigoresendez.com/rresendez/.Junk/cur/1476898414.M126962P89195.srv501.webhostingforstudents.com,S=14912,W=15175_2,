Rigoberto,

I heard what Paul Ryan said about me: that if the Republicans lose the 
Senate, I will be the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.

That sounds like a very good idea to me. It means that we can establish 
priorities for working people, and not just the billionaire class.

What would be equally exciting is if the Democrats took back the House, and 
Congressman Ryan was no longer Speaker. That would mean the clearest 
possible path to enact our agenda â€“ the most progressive agenda of any party 
in American history.

In the last day, you have responded tremendously to our call to support four 
leaders who will help shift the balance of the Senate. More than 20,000 
people have contributed more than $900,000 to ten candidates who are 
inspired by the political revolution.

During our campaign we pushed ourselves to reach goals that many thought 
impossible. That is why we set a very big, very audacious goal that we 
didn't know if we could reach, but that we thought it was very important to 
try. But you're about to smash that $1 million goal.

So, we're going to need a bigger goal.

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/big-goals?refcode=em161019-full-ns>Let's raise $2 million before tonight's final FEC deadline of the campaignfor candidates for the House and Senate. Can you start with a $15contribution between Paul Clements, Catherine Cortez-Masto, Deborah Ross,Zephyr Teachout, Morgan Carroll, Nanette Barragan, and Rick Nolan? <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/big-goals?refcode=em161019-full-ns>CONTRIBUTE<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/big-goals?refcode=em161019-full-ns>Consider for a moment the power that exists in the U.S. Senate. Right now,the Republican majority is using their power to block any meaningful actionon addressing income inequality or climate change. In addition, without aDemocratic majority the Senate is refusing to confirm federal judges and,incredibly, has left open a critical seat on the Supreme Court.With a Democratic majority, we can change all of that. What Paul Ryan isspecifically afraid of is the power of the budget committee. That committeedefines the spending priorities of the entire government. The work of thatcommittee says how much revenue the government should have, and where itsmoney should go.I have some thoughts on how the government should allocate its spending. I'msure you do, too.The first step to being able to enact our progressive agenda is taking backthe Senate. And if we take back the House... well, the sky is the limit forwhat we can achieve. <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/big-goals?refcode=em161019-full-ns> Help us reach for our new, audacious goal of raising $2 million forcandidates for the House and Senate by midnight tonight. Add a $15contribution now split between Paul Clements, Catherine Cortez-Masto,Deborah Ross, Zephyr Teachout, Morgan Carroll, Nanette Barragan, and RickNolan.Thank you for all you do.In solidarity,Bernie SandersPaid for by Friends of Bernie SandersPO BOX 391, Burlington, VT 05402This email was sent to rresendez@rigoresendez.com.
