Sign up to attend a phone banking party during our statewide day of action

Rigoberto -

Hilary Clinton’s campaign is ramping up in Texas.

According to the Texas Tribune, the Clinton campaign now “has its first paid 
Texas staff and is launching a series of meet-ups across the state to 
coalesce her support as the March 1 primary draws nearer.” Other outlets are 
reporting a major shift in the campaign’s focus toward the early March 
states.

We’ve done amazing work organizing Texas for Bernie. But we can be sure that 
as election day approaches the Clinton campaign will pour resources into 
Texas and the rest of the March 1 states.

On Sunday, January 31, the day before the Iowa caucuses, we’re organizing 
what needs to be our largest statewide day of action yet. With a historic 
upset victory in Iowa within reach, we have to be ready when the baton is 
passed to Texas.

Commit to attending a phone banking party on Sunday, January 31. We

’ll follow up shortly with details about events in your area.

If Bernie wins in Iowa and then in New Hampshire, we’ll be in the fight of 
our lives for the nomination.

The Clinton campaign will be counting on building a firewall in Texas and 
the other March 1 states to stop Bernie if he wins in Iowa and New 
Hampshire. That means we have a crucial responsibility to build a massive 
voter contact operation that can overcome the money and influence of 
entrenched establishment interests.

Our statewide day of action on January 31 will lay the foundation for the 
final month of the campaign. While the whole country watches Iowa, we’ll be 
making a historic number of calls to Texas voters and doing the work 
necessary to score another upset victory for Bernie. Join us.

Sign up to attend a phone banking party during our statewide day of action 
on Sunday, January 31.
