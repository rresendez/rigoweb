This is pretty scary, Rigoberto. A trio of polls released yesterday showed 
Hillary Clinton in a very difficult spot against Donald Trump. She led by 
one in Florida and Pennsylvania, and actually trailed him by 4 percent in 
Ohio.

For months, Bernie Sanders has out-polled Hillary Clinton against Donald 
Trump, and often by extraordinarily large margins. Because we must do 
everything we can to defeat Trump in November, our mission is to win as many 
pledged delegates as we can between now and June 14.

Then we’re going to have a contested convention where the Democratic Party 
must decide if they want the candidate with the momentum who is best 
positioned to beat Trump, or if they are willing to roll the dice and court 
disaster simply to protect the status quo for the political and financial 
establishment of this country.

But for our plan to work, we need to keep winning. And that’s why we ask:

They’re importantstates and Bernie is campaigning hard, but the outcome is up to all of us.Some people say we do better against Trump because we haven’t faced theRepublican attack machine yet. But we’ve been told our goals for the futureare utopian, and that our plans would raise taxes on middle class families.We just never thought those attacks would come in a Democratic primary.
