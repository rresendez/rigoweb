Wall Street is terrified of our campaign, Rigoberto.

With less than one week before the Iowa caucus, the billionaire class and 
the super PACs they fund are attacking our campaign relentlessly in the 
press.

They are terrified because we are running a campaign that does not represent 
their agenda. We don’t want their money, and we don’t want their super PACs. 
We are going to win differently — we are going to win because millions of 
Americans stand up as one to say we have had ENOUGH of the billionaire class 
buying our candidates and elections.

There are five days to go before Iowa, so this is your last chance to 
contribute to help us win there. We’ve also set a goal that will shock the 
political and media establishment of this country: reaching three million 
individual contributions by the Iowa caucus.

Make a $5 contribution to our campaign today to help us win in Iowa and 
reach three million individual, small-dollar contributions before the caucus 
begins.

If we are divided in these last days, the big money interests will win. But 
if we stand together, we have a chance of accomplishing what everyone once 
thought was impossible: winning the Democratic nomination for President of 
the United States and taking our country back from the billionaire class.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver
