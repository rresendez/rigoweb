Rigoberto â€” We had some amazing election results last night. We won the 
Oregon primary and came to yet another virtual tie, this time in Kentucky. 
That's 21 victories for us so far, plus three more virtual ties where the 
margin was less than one percent of the vote.

Now some people say that we have a steep hill to climb, and that is 
absolutely true. But together we have been climbing that steep hill from day 
one of our campaign. And let me be clear as I can be: we are in until the 
last ballot is cast.

This is the beginning of the final push to win California. But we are going 
to fight for every last vote, because every delegate we win is a statement 
of public support for the values we share.

Adding another$15 contribution today will help us win California and ensure we have theresources to continue our fight all the way to the Democratic Convention.I come from the working class of this country, and I will be damned if weallow the Republican Party, who represent the rich and powerful, to win thevotes of working class Americans.It is my belief that the candidate best prepared to stop Donald Trump fromwinning the White House is the candidate who supports a $15 federal minimumwage, who stands on picket lines with striking workers, and who will fightto take our democracy back from the billionaire class.In solidarity,Bernie SandersContribute<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/we-won-oregon?refcode=em160518-full-d>Paid for by Bernie 2016  <https://s.bsd.net/bernie16/main/page/-/website/billionaires.png>PO Box 905 - Burlington VT 05402 United States - (855) 4-BERNIEThis email was sent to rresendez@rigoresendez.com.
