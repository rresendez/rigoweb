Rigoberto -

Today is one of the most important days of our campaign: the final FEC 
fundraising deadline of the Democratic primary.

The last six states vote in one week, including California — the contest 
with the most delegates at stake in this race. And what today’s deadline 
will tell us is whether or not working people coming together and 
contributing small amounts of money can compete and win to the end against 
the millionaires and billionaires who have bankrolled Hillary Clinton’s 
campaign and her largest super PACs.

Our mission now is to go into the Democratic convention with as many votes, 
delegates and states as possible. From there, superdelegates will have to 
consider who is the best candidate to take on Donald Trump. That’s why I 
have to ask:

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our-final-deadline?refcode=em160531-am-s1-full>Adding one more $15 contribution before tonight’s midnight deadline willensure we have the resources we need to win in California and make ourstrongest case possible at the Democratic convention.Let me be very honest. Our path to victory is very narrow. It would take usdefying every single expectation next Tuesday and making a very convincingcase at the convention. But we have been fighting uphill from day one, and Ibelieve we owe it to ourselves to try. That’s why your contribution beforetonight’s deadline, the last of the primary, is so important.In solidarity,Bernie SandersContribute<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our-final-deadline?refcode=em160531-am-s1-full>Paid for by Bernie 2016  <https://s.bsd.net/bernie16/main/page/-/website/billionaires.png>PO Box 905 - Burlington VT 05402 United States - (855) 4-BERNIEThis email was sent to rresendez@rigoresendez.com.
