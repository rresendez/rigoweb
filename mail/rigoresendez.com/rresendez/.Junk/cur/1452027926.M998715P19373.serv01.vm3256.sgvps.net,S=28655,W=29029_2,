Rigoberto --

Greed, fraud, dishonesty, and arrogance: these are the words that best 
describe the reality of Wall Street today.

We can no longer tolerate an economy and a political system that have been 
rigged by Wall Street to benefit the wealthiest Americans in this country at 
the expense of everyone else. While President Obama deserves credit for 
getting this economy back on track after the Wall Street crash, the reality 
is there is a lot of unfinished business.

That's why today in New York City I announced my plan for taking on Wall 
Street. We must break up the banks, end their casino-style gambling, and 
fundamentally change the approach of the financial industry to focus on 
helping the American people.

 <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/m/24fb2b72/43b7f9e2/47385587/620fdd32/1656661018/VEsH/>When I am president, we will reform Wall Street and our financial system tomake it work for all Americans. I want to tell you about what I will do,then ask you to add your name to endorse our plan.Add Your Name<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/m/24fb2b72/43b7f9e2/47385587/620fdd32/1656661018/VEsE/>To those on Wall Street, let me be very clear. Greed is not good. In fact,the greed of Wall Street and corporate America is destroying the fabric ofour nation. And here is a promise I will make as president: If Wall Streetdoes not end its greed, we will end it for them.As most people know, in the 1990s and later, financial interests spentbillions of dollars in lobbying and campaign contributions to force throughCongress the deregulation of Wall Street, the repeal of the Glass-SteagallAct, and the weakening of consumer protection laws.They paid this money to show the American people all that they could do withthat freedom. Well, they sure showed the American people. In 2008, thegreed, recklessness, and illegal behavior on Wall Street nearly destroyedthe U.S. and global economy. Millions of Americans lost their jobs, theirhomes, and their life savings.Meanwhile, the American middle class continues to disappear, poverty isincreasing, and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growingwider and wider by the day. But the American people are catching on. Theyalso know that a handful of people on Wall Street have extraordinary powerover the economic and political life of our country.We must act now to change that. Our goal must be to create a financialsystem and an economy that works for all Americans, not just a handful ofbillionaires.There are eight points to my plan, and I want to go through each of themhere because I think it's important for our campaign to discuss specificpolicies with our supporters. Some of this may seem a little in the weeds,but I trust our supporters to be able to handle this kind of policydiscussion.Here's my plan for what I will do with Wall Street when I am president:Break up huge financial institutions in the first year of my administration.Within the first 100 days of my administration, I will require the Secretaryof the Treasury to establish a “Too Big to Fail” list of commercial banks,shadow banks, and insurance companies whose failure would pose acatastrophic risk to the U.S. economy without a taxpayer bailout. Within oneyear, my administration will break these institutions up so that they nolonger pose a grave threat to the economy.Reinstate a 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act to clearly separate traditionalbanking from risky investment banking and insurance services. It is notenough to tell Wall Street to "cut it out," propose a few new rules and slapon some fines. Under my administration, financial institutions will nolonger be too big to fail or too big to manage. Wall Street cannot continueto be an island unto itself, gambling trillions in risky financialinstruments. If an institution is too big to fail, it is too big to exist.End too-big-to-jail. We live in a country today that has an economy that isrigged, a campaign finance system which is corrupt, and a criminal justicesystem which often does not dispense justice. The average American sees kidsbeing arrested and sometimes even jailed for possessing marijuana. But whenit comes to Wall Street executives — some of the most wealthy and powerfulpeople in this country whose illegal behavior hurt millions of Americans —somehow nothing happens to them. No jail time. No police record. No justice.Not one major Wall Street executive has been prosecuted for causing the nearcollapse of our entire economy. That will change under my administration.“Equal Justice Under Law” will not just be words engraved on the entrance ofthe Supreme Court. It will be the standard that applies to Wall Street andall Americans.Establish a tax on Wall Street to discourage reckless gambling and encourageproductive investments in the job-creating economy. We will use the revenuefrom this tax to make public colleges and universities tuition free. Duringthe financial crisis, the middle class of this country bailed out WallStreet. Now, it’s Wall Street’s turn to help the middle class.Cap Credit Card Interest Rates and ATM Fees. We have got to stop financialinstitutions from ripping off the American people by charging sky-highinterest rates and outrageous fees. In my view, it is unacceptable thatAmericans are paying a $4 or $5 fee each time they go to the ATM. And it isunacceptable that millions of Americans are paying credit card interestrates of 20 or 30 percent.The Bible has a term for this practice. It's called usury. And in The DivineComedy, Dante reserved a special place in the Seventh Circle of Hell forsinners who charged people usurious interest rates. Today, we don't need thehellfire and the pitchforks, we don't need the rivers of boiling blood, butwe do need a national usury law.We need to cap interest rates on credit cards and consumer loans at 15percent. I would also cap ATM fees at $2.Allow Post Offices to Offer Banking Services. We also need to give Americansaffordable banking options. The reality is that, unbelievably, millions oflow-income Americans live in communities where there are no normal bankingservices. Today, if you live in a low-income community and you need to casha check or get a loan to pay for a car repair or a medical emergency, wheredo you go? You go to a payday lender who could charge an interest rate ofover 300 percent and trap you into a vicious cycle of debt. That isunacceptable.We need to stop payday lenders from ripping off millions of Americans. Postoffices exist in almost every community in our country. One important way toprovide decent banking opportunities for low-income communities is to allowthe U.S. Postal Service to engage in basic banking services, and that's whatI will fight for.Reform Credit Rating Agencies. We cannot have a safe and sound financialsystem if we cannot trust the credit agencies to accurately rate financialproducts. The only way we can restore that trust is to make sure creditrating agencies cannot make a profit from Wall Street. Under myadministration, we will turn for-profit credit rating agencies intonon-profit institutions, independent from Wall Street. No longer will WallStreet be able to pick and choose which credit agency will rate theirproducts.Reform the Federal Reserve. We need to structurally reform the FederalReserve to make it a more democratic institution responsive to the needs ofordinary Americans, not just the billionaires on Wall Street. It isunacceptable that the Federal Reserve has been hijacked by the very bankersit is in charge of regulating. When Wall Street was on the verge ofcollapse, the Federal Reserve acted with a fierce sense of urgency to savethe financial system. We need the Fed to act with the same boldness tocombat the unemployment crisis and fulfill its full employment mandate.So my message to you is straightforward: I’ll rein in Wall Street's recklessbehavior so they can’t crash our economy again.Will Wall Street like me? No. Will they begin to play by the rules if I’mpresident? You better believe it. <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/m/24fb2b72/43b7f9e2/47385587/620fdd32/1656661018/VEsF/> That is our plan to create an economy that works for allAmericans, not just a handful of billionaires. If you agree with what wewant to do, add your name to say that you stand with me.No president alone, not Bernie Sanders or anyone else, can effectivelyaddress the crises facing the working families of this country without apowerful grassroots movement. When we stand together, there is nothing wecannot accomplish.Thank you for standing with me.In solidarity,Bernie SandersContribute<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/m/24fb2b72/43b7f9e2/47385587/620fdd33/1656661018/VEsC/>Paid for by Bernie 2016  <https://s.bsd.net/bernie16/main/page/-/website/billionaires.png>PO Box 905 - Burlington VT 05402 United States - (855) 4-BERNIEThis email was sent to rresendez@rigoresendez.com.
