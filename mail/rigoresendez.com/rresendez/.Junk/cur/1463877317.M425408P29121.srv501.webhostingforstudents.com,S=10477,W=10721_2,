When we started this campaign, my greatest fear was that if we did not do 
well that it would be a setback not just for me, but for the ideas driving 
our campaign.

We had no campaign organization, no money, and very little name recognition. 
The corporate media called us "fringe," we were taking on the entire 
Democratic establishment, and we were down 60 points or more in the national 
polls.

Then a supporter from Chicago, Illinois made the first contribution to our 
campaign — for $3. A few minutes later, $50 from a supporter in California, 
then $10 from someone in Georgia. A little more than 12 months later, I am 
humbled to share that our campaign has received more than 7.6 million 
contributions through April, more than any presidential candidate at this 
point in a campaign ever. And we’re just getting started.

Your support has powered us to 21 victories and a much larger lead against 
Donald Trump than Secretary Clinton’s campaign. So we’ve created a website 
to show everyone the depth and diversity of our political revolution. It 
<https://berniesanders.com/revolution/> ’s very important that you visit and 
share it with everyone you know today.
