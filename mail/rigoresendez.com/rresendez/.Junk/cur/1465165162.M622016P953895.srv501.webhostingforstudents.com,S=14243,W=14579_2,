Rigoberto,

When you wake up on June 8, the morning after California and five other 
states vote, will you be able to say that you did everything you could to 
help Bernie win?

Because right now in California, it's very, very, very close.

California Primary Poll (NBC News)
Hillary Clinton: 49%
Bernie Sanders: 47%

This is important: the same poll says that with a higher turnout, we are 
actually winning. And if we win California, it will send the STRONGEST 
message possible to the Democratic establishment heading into the convention 
in July. That's why we have to ask you to help in two ways:

Yes, I'll make some calls this weekend 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/win-more-states-for-bernie?source=em160602-full> 
I'll Contribute to 
<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/lets-win-california?refcode=em160602-full-e>
help win California

How else do we know it's going to be a nail biter in California? Secretary 
Clinton knows it's close too â€“ she's canceling events in New Jersey and is 
racing to California to campaign. (She kept her big-dollar fundraisers on 
the schedule though.)

We have elections happening in New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, South 
Dakota, and Montana on Tuesday night, in addition to California. We think we 
can do very well across the board, and we need you to do everything in your 
power to help us win.

Why? Because every vote, every delegate, and every state that we win gives 
us power at the Democratic convention, and victory is the strongest message 
we can send to the political establishment.

Are you in to help Bernie win?

Yes, I can volunteer to call voters in California and other upcoming states 
this weekend. 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/win-more-states-for-bernie?source=em160602-full>

Yes, I can contribute $15 to Bernie 2016 to help win California and other 
states on Tuesday. 
<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/lets-win-california?refcode=em160602-full-e>

Let's win on Tuesday.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver
Campaign Manager
Bernie 2016
