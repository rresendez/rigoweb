The Supreme Court guaranteed a woman's right to choose in the Roe v. Wade 
decision 43 years ago today. This was a tremendous step to protect women's 
health and to affirm their control of their own bodies.

Unfortunately, since the Roe v. Wade decision, extreme right-wing 
politicians in states have made it more and more difficult for women to 
actually access abortion care, aided in many cases by the federal Hyde 
Amendment and other anti-abortion policies. Nearly a quarter of these 
restrictions have come in the last five years. This is unacceptable.

The extreme right-wing works tirelessly to make it more difficult for women 
to access reproductive health care. Republicans in office work to shut down 
clinics while extremists terrorize health care providers and their patients. 
Making women travel hundreds of miles, wait weeks for an appointment and 
face harassment at the clinic door is a national disgrace.

So today, on the anniversary of this important Supreme Court decision, we 
must affirm not only the right to have an abortion, but we must protect the 
right to access a doctor or clinic who can perform that procedure.

 <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/m/24fb2d09/43b7f9e2/43fb2a50/620e7161/3585366030/VEsH/>Add your name to mine if you agree we must expand access to reproductivehealth care and protect Roe v. Wade.We are not going back to the days when women had to risk their lives to endan unwanted pregnancy. The decision about abortion must remain a decisionfor a woman and her doctor to make, not the government.We are not going to allow the extreme right-wing to defund PlannedParenthood, we are going to expand it. Planned Parenthood provides vitalhealthcare services for millions of people, who rely on its clinics everyyear for affordable, quality health care services including cancerprevention, STI and HIV testing and general primary health care services.The current attempt to malign Planned Parenthood is part of a long-termsmear campaign by people who want to deny women in this country the right tocontrol their own bodies.We are not going back to the days when women did not have full access tobirth control. Incredibly, almost all of the Republicans in Congress are infavor of giving any employer who provides health insurance, or any insurancecompany, the ability to deny coverage for contraception or any other kind ofprocedure if the employer had a “moral” objection to it. That isunacceptable.Under my administration, we will protect and expand the fundamental rightsof women to control their own bodies. I promise to only nominate SupremeCourt Justices who support Roe v. Wade. Our Medicare-for-all plan wouldcover reproductive health care, including abortion, because all health careis a right, not a privilege. And I would work to repeal the federal HydeAmendment, which currently restricts the federal government from spendingany money on abortion care. That is wrong, and it will be abolished when Iam president. <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/m/24fb2d09/43b7f9e2/43fb2a50/620e7161/3585366030/VEsE/> Add your name to mine if you agree we must expand access toreproductive health care and protect Roe v.
