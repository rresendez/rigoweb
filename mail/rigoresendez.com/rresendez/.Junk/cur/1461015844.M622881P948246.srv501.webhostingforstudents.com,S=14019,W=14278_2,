There’s something I need to share with you, Rigoberto, and it’s probably 
going to anger you. It should probably anger everyone. Here it is:

Our opponent is bending campaign finance rules to their breaking point all 
so Wall Street fat cats and people like Walmart's Alice Walton can get away 
with giving hundreds of thousands of dollars in a single contribution to 
benefit the Clinton campaign.

You already know about the fundraiser Hillary Clinton held where a couple 
could contribute $353,000 to sit at a table with George Clooney. That money 
doesn’t go directly to the Clinton campaign, it goes to something called the 
"Hillary Victory Fund" – another account that has raised almost $35 million.

Well, for MONTHS the Clinton campaign has been saying the primary purpose of 
that fund is to support the DNC and state parties. But that’s not even close 
to true.

According to the Hillary Victory Fund’s most recent FEC report, the vast 
majority of the money they spent in 2016 – $25 MILLION – went directly 
towards helping the Clinton campaign itself.

So, what can we do about it? We can either sit back and shrug our shoulders 
at yet another obscene injustice. Or, we can fight. I say we fight.

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/we-must-keep-fighting?refcode=em160418-s2-full>Contribute $15 to Bernie’s campaign today to help us win New York and as away of saying you have had ENOUGH of the way Hillary Clinton’s campaign isfunding its campaign and super PACs.So, this is distressing, but it’s probably to be expected. The Clintoncampaign has raised the majority of its money from people giving the maximumamount of money under the law and her super PACs have raised more than $15million from Wall Street and the financial industry alone.Do you believe we can change a corrupt system by taking its money? BernieSanders says no, and that’s the choice New Yorkers face on Tuesday.The choice you face right now, is are you willing to contribute $15 to fightback and win this primary, the White House and take our country back fromthe billionaire class?
