Rigoberto -

I want to share something with you that is probably going to make you angry, 
but then I am going to give you an opportunity to do something about it.

For months, you've heard the Clinton campaign endlessly repeat in interviews 
and on social media that they have raised millions and millions of dollars 
for state parties through something called the "Hillary Victory Fund." 
They've even used it as an attack line to insinuate Bernie wasn't willing to 
help down-ballot Democrats.

Well, yesterday morning, thanks to a Politico investigation, we found out 
that less than 1 percent of the $61 million raised by the Victory Fund has 
stayed in state party coffers. And indeed, the majority of the money spent 
by the Victory Fund has gone to benefit Hillary Clinton's primary campaign 
against us. The piece said some state party fundraisers believe they are 
basically acting as "money laundering conduits."

There's more, but first let me get to the part where you can take action. In 
recent weeks, the Clinton campaign has expressed a lot of interest in what 
is important to Bernie's supporters. Here's your chance to send a message 
about our distaste for big-money in politics:

Sign our petition calling on the Clinton campaign to stop bending campaign 
finance rules to their breaking point, and immediately transfer all the 
money allowable to the state parties participating in the "Hillary Victory 
Fund." 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/victory-fund?source=em160503-sub-d&utm_medium=email&utm_source=jeffweaver&utm_campaign=victory-fund&utm_content=petition>

Here's how the scheme works for the Clinton campaign:

Rich people like Alice Walton of Walmart who have already contributed the 
maximum amount allowable to the Clinton campaign can contribute an 
additional $350,000-plus to the Victory Fund.

The first $33,400 of her contribution is supposed to go the DNC, and the 
rest divided up between participating state parties. But that's not what's 
been happening. The Victory Fund has mostly been doing one of two things 
with Ms. Walton's money:

1. Taking that money and spending it on advertisements and small-dollar 
fundraising solicitations. Then they take all the small-dollar contributions 
and data reaped from Alice Walton's contribution and transfer it directly to 
the Clinton campaign. This tactic is basically a way for them to benefit 
from a contribution much larger than the legal limit from Alice Walton.

2. They take Alice Walton's money and transfer it to state parties, who then 
immediately transfer it to the DNC. Often times they do it without the state 
party even knowing because the Clinton campaign controls many of the bank 
accounts involved. So at the end of the day, most of the state parties have 
received exactly $0 from their Victory Fund arrangement.

So, now that we know the Clinton campaign is taking advantage of state 
parties to skirt fundraising limits on her presidential campaign, it's time 
for her to do the right thing and let the state parties keep their fair 
share of the cash:

Sign our petition calling on the Clinton campaign to stop bending campaign 
finance rules to their breaking point, and immediately transfer all the 
money allowable to the state parties participating in the "Hillary Victory 
Fund." 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/victory-fund?source=em160503-sub-d&utm_medium=email&utm_source=jeffweaver&utm_campaign=victory-fund&utm_content=petition>

It's unfortunate that Hillary Clinton has benefited from tens of millions of 
dollars in cash transfers and advertising to campaign against us in the 
primary. But it's not too late for her campaign to do the right thing by the 
state parties we're going to need to win elections up and down the ticket 
this November.

I'm sure if you sign our petition, that is something they will notice.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver
