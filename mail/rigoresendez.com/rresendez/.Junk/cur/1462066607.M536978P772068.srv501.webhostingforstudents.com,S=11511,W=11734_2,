Rigoberto -

When we started this campaign, I wrote that "I run not to oppose any man or 
woman, but to propose new and far-reaching policies to deal with the crises 
of our times."

I am very good at arithmetic, and I can count delegates. We are behind 
today, but you know what? A path forward still exists. And our job right now 
is not only to transform our country, but the Democratic Party as well.

And you need to know that every vote we win going forward and every delegate 
we send to the Democratic convention not only moves us closer to the 
nomination but also moves our party and our country closer to the ideas 
we're fighting for.

Today is a very important day for our political revolution: it's the second 
to last FEC fundraising deadline before the end of the primary. And every 
member of the corporate media and political establishment in this country 
will be looking to see if you're willing to continue this fight together. 
And that's why I have to ask:

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/april_deadline?refcode=em160430-s1>Match your previous $15 contribution before our critical midnight FECfundraising deadline and we'll have the resources we need to continue ourfight all the way through the Democratic primary.It's not just about how much money we are able to raise before tonight'sdeadline, but the total number of individual contributions we receive. Whenthe corporate media and political establishment look at our FEC report,they're going to see every single donation as a continuing demonstration ofsupport for the values we share. That's why it's so important you add yoursbefore midnight.In solidarity,Bernie SandersContribute<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/april_deadline?refcode=em160430-s1>Paid for by Bernie 2016  <https://s.bsd.net/bernie16/main/page/-/website/billionaires.png>PO Box 905 - Burlington VT 05402 United States - (855) 4-BERNIEThis email was sent to rresendez@rigoresendez.com.
