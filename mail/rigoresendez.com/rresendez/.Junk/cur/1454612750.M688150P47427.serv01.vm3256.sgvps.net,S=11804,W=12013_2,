Rigoberto -

The CEO of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd Blankfein, said yesterday our campaign 
represents a dangerous moment, "not just for Wall Street, but for anyone who 
is a little bit out of line."

I have to say, I find it a little beyond comprehension that Lloyd Blankfein 
would lecture our campaign about "dangerous moments" after Wall Street 
received huge bailouts from the working families of this country, when their 
greed and recklessness caused millions of Americans to lose their jobs, 
livelihoods, and homes just a few years ago. His arrogance has no end.

Now Wall Street is pouring money into other campaigns. But I am here to tell 
you that we don’t want their money and we don’t want their super PACs. We 
are going to do it differently. We are going to win together on the strength 
of millions of small donations.

They never expected us to battle to avirtual draw in Iowa, and they are starting to get a bit nervous about NewHampshire too.The next primary is less than one week away, and we have a slight lead inthe polls despite opposition from the economic and political establishmentin the state.
