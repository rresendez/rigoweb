Rigoberto:

The political revolution was never just about electing a president. It's a 
movement of millions of Americans uniting to upend the status quo and 
transform our country. That's why we're coming together around dozens of 
strong candidates — from school board to Senate — to win important victories 
on November 8th.

We need to elect a wave of progressive candidates all over this country who 
will fight for the values we share, and that's why I'm asking you today to 
support three people who have long stood with our political revolution:

Make a $15 contribution right now to help elect three strong progressives 
who support our movement: Zephyr Teachout, Rick Nolan and Pramila Jayapal. 
<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our-revolution-house?refcode=em160812>

Contribute $15 
<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our-revolution-house?refcode=em160812>

These candidates endorsed Bernie's campaign for president because they 
believe in our political revolution. They had the guts to take on the 
establishment when it wasn't necessarily going to be easy and we know they 
will be strong and consistent allies in the fight for economic, social, 
environmental and racial justice in the House of Representatives.

Zephyr Teachout (New York): Zephyr is running in a swing district, but she's 
running on a progressive agenda that will win working people on both sides 
of the aisle. Zephyr wrote a book on political corruption because she 
understands deeply how wealthy campaign contributors are buying our 
politicians and rigging our economy. In Congress, she'll fight to ban 
fracking and rein in Wall Street. This won't be an easy race and she needs 
your financial support.

Rick Nolan (Minnesota): Rick represents one of the most competitive 
congressional districts in the country, but he's been a strong fighter for 
enacting single-payer health care, overturning Citizens United and ending 
offshore tax havens. He's running against a multimillionaire CEO who thinks 
he can pour millions into television ads, win himself a congressional seat, 
and then cast votes to cut taxes on the ultra-rich.

Pramila Jayapal (Washington): Pramila was a leader in the fight for paid 
sick leave and a $15 minimum wage in Seattle. She's been taking on the 
ruling class in Washington state for years, and now we need to make sure she 
gets past a tough general election so that she can be one of our strongest 
allies in Congress.

Let's win these races. Make a $15 contribution right now to elect these 
progressives who are going to fight for our revolution in Congress. 
<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our-revolution-house?refcode=em160812>

I believe that when future historians look back and describe how our country 
moved forward and created a government which represents all people and not 
just the few, they will note that, to a significant degree, that effort 
began with the political revolution of 2016 and the tidal wave of strong 
leaders we elected all over the country.

Thank you for all you're doing to power our movement. Let's keep it going.

In solidarity,

Shannon Jackson
Executive Director
Our Revolution
