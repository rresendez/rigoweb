Rigoberto -

It’s no secret that when we started this campaign, we had no money, very 
little name recognition, and we were taking on the entire Democratic 
establishment in this country.

So when a Democratic National Committee vice chair, Congresswoman Tulsi 
Gabbard, was disinvited from our first debate after calling for more of 
them, people took notice. And when Tulsi quit her post at the DNC to endorse 
our campaign, it sent shockwaves through the political establishment.

For the last several months, Tulsi has been a tireless surrogate for our 
campaign. She has joined me at rallies, appeared in ads, and now we’re 
campaigning across California where almost every recent poll shows us within 
just a few points of Hillary Clinton.

Today, I want to ask you to join me in accomplishing two goals: help us win 
in California on Tuesday and ensure Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is 
re-elected in November.

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/tulsi-gabbard?refcode=em160604-full>Split a $15 contribution between our campaign and Tulsi Gabbard’sre-election, and we will have the resources we need to win in California onTuesday while supporting a great progressive leader we need in Congress.Congresswoman Gabbard is one of the important voices of a new generation ofleaders. As a veteran of the Iraq War, she understands the cost of war andis fighting to create a foreign policy that not only protects America butkeeps us out of perpetual wars that we should not be in.Tulsi has been a great friend to our political revolution. And because ofpeople like her, and people like you, we have a great chance to winCalifornia on Tuesday night and close this primary out strong. That’s whysplitting your contribution today is so important.In solidarity,Bernie SandersContribute<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/tulsi-gabbard?refcode=em160604-full>Paid for by Bernie 2016  <https://s.bsd.net/bernie16/main/page/-/website/billionaires.png>PO Box 905 - Burlington VT 05402 United States - (855) 4-BERNIEThis email was sent to rresendez@rigoresendez.com.
