Bernie asked a room full of Iowans — including me — to share their stories 
about living on Social Security and disability benefits this week.

One gal at the event spoke about living on disability, and how she makes 
only $10,000 a year. She talked about how hard it is to live on nothing — 
how hard it is to try to do something nice for your family when you make so 
little.

I was in tears when she spoke, because I knew exactly what she meant. So 
when Bernie asked others to share their stories, I told mine.

"It’s so hard to do anything to pay your bills," I told Bernie and the 
crowd. "You are ashamed all the time. I worked three, four, five jobs 
sometimes — always minimum wage. I have a degree. I’m divorced. I’ve been 
waiting for disability to come through, so my parents have to support me. It’s 
just hard."

Last year I only made about $5,000 from Social Security benefits. Folks in 
my situation often feel ashamed of how we're living and so we want to do 
better. We want to contribute to our communities, but sometimes our bodies 
can only do so much.

Even though I can't afford much, I contributed $15 to Bernie because I've 
never felt before that a candidate would appreciate a donation from someone 
like me.

With the Iowa caucus happening Monday night, there's not much time left to 
make a contribution that will help Bernie win in Iowa. Can you please 
contribute $5 to Bernie now?

Donate $5 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/m/24fb2ddb/43b7f9e2/4173d44e/620e253c/3922817196/VEsE/>

I support Bernie Sanders because he's running for president for the right 
reason: he genuinely cares about America, and isn't satisfied with the way 
things are.

The political process often overlooks people like me. That's why I'm so 
inspired by Bernie. I like that he doesn't have a super PAC and doesn't want 
that kind of big money. Because he rejects that kind of politics, I know 
that he's free to care about people's real needs.

Bernie wants to expand Social Security benefits to help regular folks get 
by. He wants to make a living wage, so that people who work for minimum wage 
can get out of poverty. When you're not making much, it's hard to keep up 
with your bills — and it would give me a sense of pride to be able to pay 
them on my own.

I know I'm not alone. Since I shared my story yesterday, I've heard from so 
many people who are stuck in similar situations, but who have the same hopes 
about what it would mean if Bernie became president.

I had no idea that sharing my story would resonate so much. I wasn't 
thinking about having an effect across America when I spoke up. I just 
wanted Bernie to know what it's like to be in my shoes.

Bernie gets it. That's why I want him to win.

When I made my small contribution to Bernie, I wasn't sure it would have 
much of an impact. But knowing that people all over the country are doing 
the same thing, contributing whatever they can afford, I know that we have 
the chance to win.
