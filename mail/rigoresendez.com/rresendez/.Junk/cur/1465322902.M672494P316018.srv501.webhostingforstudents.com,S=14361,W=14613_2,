Rigoberto -

You ask anyone running for office what they hate most about it, and I 
guarantee that virtually every single candidate will say that it's raising 
money.

The way that you have helped me run for president is absolutely 
unprecedented. I get to talk to voters, while my opponent has to talk to 
donors.

The candidates we're endorsing for other races are seeing similar results. 
We funded state legislative candidates' entire campaigns through one email. 
We completely transformed several congressional races because of your 
generosity.

That's why today I'm endorsing 2 new progressives – Eric Kingson in New 
York, and Paul Clements in Michigan – and asking you to again support Lucy 
Flores, Zephyr Teachout, Pramila Jayapal, and Tim Canova in their races for 
Congress.

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/bernie-congress?refcode=em160607-v2>Split a $15 contribution between our campaign and these six progressives weneed in Congress. Your support can change their races overnight and helpelect progressives across the country.After 10,000 people contributed to Chris Pearson, who's running for theVermont State Senate, his entire campaign was funded. For the wholeelection! Chris said in response, "What it means for me is now I don't haveto spend time asking a small number of donors for big checks."When you helped raise huge sums of money for Zephyr Teachout's campaign inNew York, she was able to cancel her fundraising calls and head out on thepicket line with striking workers throughout her district.Lucy Flores' election is in just one week, and your support for her thisspring completely upended her primary. Your support for her today could puther close to victory.I'm endorsing Eric Kingson for Congress in New York because he led the fightto protect Social Security, and I'm endorsing Paul Clements in Michiganbecause he can help unseat the leading climate change denier in Congress. Iknow that we can transform their races too, like we did for Chris, Zephyr,and Lucy.What we are proving – you and me, Rigoberto – is that it is possible to takeback our country from the billionaire class. It is possible to stopmillionaires and billionaires from buying our democracy. And we can do it$27 at a time. <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/bernie-congress?refcode=em160607-v2> Split a $15 contribution between our campaign and those of thecongressional candidates I support so that together, we can elect aprogressive Congress not beholden to special interests.Our movement is so powerful that we can change congressional electionsovernight.
