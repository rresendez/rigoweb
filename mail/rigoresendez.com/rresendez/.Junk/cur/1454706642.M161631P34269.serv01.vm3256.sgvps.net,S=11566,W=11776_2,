Rigoberto -

When we started our campaign, we were down 44 points in New Hampshire. 
Tonight, just four days away from the state’s primary, our political 
revolution has a real chance to win.

If you watched tonight’s debate, you saw the important differences between 
our visions for America. As I said in the debate, I believe what is required 
in this moment is to think big.

I believe that we can provide health care for every man, woman, and child in 
this country. I believe that we can create an economy that works for 
everyone, and not just a handful of wealthy elites. And I believe that we 
can put an end to millionaires and billionaires buying our candidates and 
elections.

But we have to do well in New Hampshire if we’re going to move that vision 
forward. So I have to ask directly:

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/against-all-odds?refcode=em160204>Can I count on you to contribute $5 to our campaign ahead of Tuesday's NewHampshire primary? It is a critical state for our campaign, so yourcontribution right now is more important than ever before.A few days ago, the people of Iowa showed that, against all odds, ourpolitical revolution has a chance to win this election. I don’t take moneyfrom millionaires and billionaires. There is no super PAC waiting in thewings. But I know that if we stand together, I believe we can do even betterin New Hampshire next week.In solidarity,Bernie SandersContribute $5<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/against-all-odds?refcode=em160204>Paid for by Bernie 2016  <https://s.bsd.net/bernie16/main/page/-/website/billionaires.png>PO Box 905 - Burlington VT 05402 United States - (855) 4-BERNIEThis email was sent to rresendez@rigoresendez.com.
