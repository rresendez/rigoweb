Rigoberto -

Raising money is one of the worst parts of having to run for office in this 
country. The outrageous sums it takes to run and win elections in the United 
States is one of the reasons Congress doesn’t regulate corporate America, 
but corporate America regulates Congress.

I am proud of the way our campaign has raised money. You should be too. We 
don’t have a super PAC, and I am not relying on millionaires and 
billionaires for money. This campaign is funded by over 2 million individual 
contributions made by working Americans who have had enough of the 
billionaire class buying our elections.

Tonight, our campaign faces an important challenge — the final FEC 
fundraising deadline of the year. So, I need to just come right out and ask 
directly:
