Rigoberto –

A whopping total of 694 pledged delegates are up for grabs on Tuesday, and – 
especially given the latest polling out of California – we believe we have a 
good chance of winning a big majority of them. But we need your help to do 
that.

Thousands of in-state volunteers are hitting the streets in these final days 
to find Bernie voters and get them to the polls. But they just can't knock 
the door of every voter we need to contact.

So our task this weekend is pretty simple: call every single Bernie 
supporter we can in the upcoming states, and make sure they have a plan to 
vote on Tuesday. Can Bernie count on you to volunteer a couple hours of your 
time?

Yes, I'll make some calls this weekend 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/win-more-states-for-bernie?source=em160603>

If you've never called voters for Bernie before, now is the time to take the 
plunge. Calling on our Bernie Dialer is easy; you just need a computer or a 
tablet, and a phone. We provide a simple script for you to follow, connect 
you directly to the targeted voters, and we have dedicated volunteers 
standing by on livechat to help out if you run into any problems.

Our plan is to go into the Democratic convention in Philadelphia with as 
many votes, delegates and states as possible. From there, the superdelegates 
will have to consider who is the best candidate to take on Donald Trump – 
and the polls consistently show Bernie is that candidate.

So don't let this opportunity slip by. Our collective efforts this weekend 
have the potential to shock the political establishment and show the 
billionaire class that we've had enough of super-PAC-funded politics as 
usual. Your involvement will help write a pivotal chapter in American 
political history, so we're asking you to step up and commit as much 
volunteer time as you can. 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/win-more-states-for-bernie?source=em160603>

In solidarity,

Team Bernie

P.S. If you'd like to learn more about our weekend of action and the 
importance of these June 7th contests, please  <http://bernie.to/volstream> 
join us on a special livestream event tonight (Friday) at 9 pm ET/6 pm PT.
