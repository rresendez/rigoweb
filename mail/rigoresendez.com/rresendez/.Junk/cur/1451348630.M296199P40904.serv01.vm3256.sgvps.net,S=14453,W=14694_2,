Rigoberto -

Last week, Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager told supporters that our 
campaign could raise more money than theirs this month. He said the race was 
close and warned that Bernie could very well win in Iowa and New Hampshire.

Can our unprecedented number of grassroots supporters raise more money from 
small-dollar donations than Hillary Clinton has from high-dollar events? We 
have no idea. But it is very important that we push ourselves to try.

If everyone steps up one more time before Thursday’s official FEC deadline, 
our fundraising numbers will send two unmistakably important messages about 
Bernie Sanders and our campaign: that we can win, and that we can do it 
without begging millionaires and billionaires for money.

 <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/m/24fb2841/43b7f9e2/487f69e2/62122900/1945048235/VEsH/>It is very important that you make a $3 contribution to our campaign beforeThursday night’s official FEC fundraising deadline, the final and mostimportant one of 2015.The title of the Clinton campaign’s message to supporters was “Two thingsyou should know about Bernie Sanders.” Well, here are two things we thinkeveryone should know about Bernie Sanders:1. Bernie Sanders is the candidate of everyday people, not the wealthy. We’ve received more than 2.3 million individual contributions and counting,averaging less than $30 apiece. That’s more than any candidate in history atthis point in a campaign for president. You should be very proud of that.2. The primary is close and Bernie is the strongest general electioncandidate. According to the most recent polls, we are ahead in New Hampshireand are closing the gap in Iowa. We have a chance to win in both states andare working day and night to make that happen. Not only that, but a numberof independent polls show Bernie fares better in many of the generalelection match-ups against Republicans.Want to make sure we don’t end up with President Trump? Want to electDemocrats up and down the ballot? Bernie is our best chance. And the bestthing you can do right now to ensure he’s the Democratic Party nominee ismake a contribution ahead of our final FEC fundraising deadline of the year: <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/m/24fb2841/43b7f9e2/487f69e2/62122900/1945048235/VEsE/> Make a $3 contribution to help fund our political revolution’s victories in Iowa, New Hampshire and beyond.We’re getting pretty close to making some final budget decisions before thefirst votes. Your contribution today will ensure we have the resources tocompete and win.In solidarity,Jeff WeaverCampaign ManagerBernie 2016 <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/m/24fb2841/43b7f9e2/487f69e2/62122900/1945048235/VEsF/>Paid for by Bernie 2016  <https://s.bsd.net/bernie16/main/page/-/website/billionaires.png>PO Box 905 - Burlington VT 05402 United States - (855) 4-BERNIEThis email was sent to rresendez@rigoresendez.com.
