Rigoberto -

There are few people who have done more to address the obscene proliferation 
of money in politics than Russ Feingold.

There is also no one the Koch brothers want to keep out of the U.S. Senate 
more than Russ Feingold.

Russ is running to win a seat in the Senate from Republican Ron Johnson, 
someone who was called the Koch brothersâ€™ "model legislator."

Russ Feingold is someone we need in the Senate, and I'm proud to endorse his 
campaign. Can you join me in helping elect Russ Feingold?

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/feingold-for-senate?refcode=em160526-s1-full-d>Split a $15 contribution between Bernie 2016 and Russ Feingold before ourfinal FEC fundraising deadline of the primary to show that we can electsenators who don't need big money in politics.Let me tell you a little about what made Russ so effective when he was inthe Senate. Russ was the sole vote in the Senate against the USA Patriot Actin 2001. He opposed the war in Iraq, he fought disastrous trade deals andworked to reform our health care system. Russ was also an author of theMcCain-Feingold Act to reform our corrupt campaign finance system.Meanwhile, his Republican opponent credits a Koch brothers organization withinspiring him to run for Senate in the first place. Ron Johnson wants toprivatize veterans' health care and even said he supports Donald Trump asthe Republican nominee.Russ has already faced a huge influx of big money trying to keep him out ofthe Senate. In fact, the Koch brothers had their ads from a $2 millioncampaign against Russ taken off the air by TV stations when they were notedto be "false, misleading, and deceptive."That won't be the last time the Koch brothers try to take out Russ. We needto make sure that Russ can fight back and win. <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/feingold-for-senate?refcode=em160526-s1-full-d> Please make a $15 contribution between Bernie 2016 and RussFeingold before our final FEC fundraising deadline of the primary to showthe billionaire class that they can't buy our elections.In solidarity,Bernie SandersContribute<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/feingold-for-senate?refcode=em160526-s1-full-d>Paid for by Bernie 2016  <https://s.bsd.net/bernie16/main/page/-/website/billionaires.png>PO Box 905 - Burlington VT 05402 United States - (855) 4-BERNIEThis email was sent to rresendez@rigoresendez.com.
