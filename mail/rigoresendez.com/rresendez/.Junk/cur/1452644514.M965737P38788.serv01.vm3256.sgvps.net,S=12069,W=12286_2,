Rigoberto -

Earlier today, Hillary Clinton’s campaign unleashed a series of vicious and 
coordinated attacks against Bernie’s universal health care plan. They 
falsely claimed Bernie’s plan would end the Children’s Health Insurance 
Program, dismantle Medicare and strip millions of people of their coverage.

Here is the truth: Bernie’s plan would guarantee health care as a right for 
every man, woman, and child, and it would be implemented in every state in 
the country regardless of who is governor.

We have made tremendous gains in Iowa, but if we lost because Hillary 
Clinton’s campaign scared voters into thinking Bernie’s plan would cost them 
their coverage, it could set our vision for universal health care back at 
least a generation.

We simply cannot let that happen.
