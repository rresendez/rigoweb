Does this sound familiar to you, Rigoberto?

"The corporations and special interests have their voice in Congress, and 
they have too many members scared of their power. What Congress needs is a 
progressive voice who is unafraid to take on these powerful interests – who 
is willing to fight for all Americans, not just the wealthiest 1 percent."

That's how Pramila Jayapal announced she was running for Congress. Pramila 
is exactly the kind of person I'm going to need in Congress when I am 
president. Let's help make sure she gets there.
