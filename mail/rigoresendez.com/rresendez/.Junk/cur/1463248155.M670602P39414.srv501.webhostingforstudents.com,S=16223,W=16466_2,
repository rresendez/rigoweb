 <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/immigration-raids-petition?source=em160514-full>Sign my petition asking President Obama to stop his plans for raids anddeportations of hundreds of women and children who fled horrific violence inLatin America.  _____Rigoberto -My father Eli immigrated to America from Poland in 1921 after World War I atthe age of 17. He was not a refugee fleeing war, although much of his familylater became victims of the Holocaust. He came to America looking to make abetter life. He never made a lot of money, but it didn’t matter because hewas able to start a family and send his two sons to college. That meant theworld to him and he loved this country.While my father came here as an immigrant seeking economic opportunity, manyimmigrants arrived in our country fleeing war, oppression and violence. Thisis true today for thousands of women and unaccompanied children who came toour country in the last several years fleeing horrific violence in LatinAmerica.This week the media reported something that I find not just wrong, butinhumane: President Obama is currently planning "a month-long series ofraids in May and June to deport hundreds of Central American mothers andchildren" who came to our country fleeing that same violence.Sending women and children back into harm's way after they already fledhorrendous violence in Central America is painful and inhumane, and must bestopped. <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/immigration-raids-petition?source=em160514-full> Sign my petition asking President Obama to stop these raids andto make sure that families fleeing violence in Central America are protectedfrom deportation.Sign My Petition<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/immigration-raids-petition?source=em160514-full> »Donald Trump has of course called for building a "Great Wall" along theborder with Mexico. Hillary Clinton previously said that these same childrenwho fled violence in Latin America "should be sent back" in order to "send aclear message."I happen to see things differently. I don't believe that the United Statesshould turn away from our historic role as a haven for the oppressed.I recently met a young Salvadoran woman who came to the United States on herown at the age of 15 to flee gangs trying to recruit her. I’ve also spokenwith many children who have told me with tears streaming down their facesthat they live in daily fear that their parents will be taken away.The United States of America must continue to be a refuge for the poor, thetired, the oppressed, and certainly for women and children fleeing horrificviolence.I urge President Obama to use his executive authority to protect families byextending Temporary Protective Status for those who fled from CentralAmerica, and I ask you to join me. <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/immigration-raids-petition?source=em160514-full> Add your name to mine to ask President Obama to stop plannedraids and deportations of families fleeing violence in Central and LatinAmerica.
