Rigoberto,

When we began this campaign a little over a year ago we were considered to 
be a fringe campaign. But over the last year, I think that has changed just 
a little bit.

As of last night, we have won 22 state primaries and caucuses with more than 
11 million votes.

What we understand, and what every one of us has always understood, is that 
real change never occurs from the top on down, always from the bottom on up.

That is the history of America. Our fight is to transform our country and to 
understand that we are in this together. That is what OUR movement is about.

The struggle continues. We are going to fight for every vote in Tuesday's 
primary in Washington, DC, and then we will bring our political revolution 
to the Democratic convention in Philadelphia.

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/the-struggle-continues?refcode=em160608-full>Say that you will continue to fight for the progressive future our countryneeds by adding a $15 contribution to our campaign today.I am pretty good at arithmetic, and I know that the fight in front of us isa very, very steep fight, but we will continue to fight for every vote andevery delegate we can get.But you know that what we are doing is about more than Bernie Sanders. It isall of us together. It is what this movement is about. It is millions ofpeople from coast to coast standing up and looking around them and knowingthat we can do much, much better as a nation.That whether Wall Street likes it, whether corporate America likes it,whether wealthy campaign contributors like it, whether the corporate medialikes it, we together know what our job is. And that is to bring theAmerican people together to create a government that works for us, not the 1percent.Our fight is to transform our country and to understand that we are in thistogether. To understand that all of what we believe is what the majority ofthe American people believe. And to understand that the struggle continues. <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/the-struggle-continues?refcode=em160608-full> Adding a $15 contribution now will show that you want to seeour fight for a progressive future continue all the way to the Democraticconvention.
