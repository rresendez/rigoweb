Rigoberto -

In just three days, we will be competing in the Washington, D.C. primary. 
This is the last primary of the Democratic nominating process and we are 
fighting hard for every last vote until the polls close on Tuesday night.

From there, we will take our issues to the Democratic Convention in 
Philadelphia next month.

But no matter what happens, the truth is that no president, not Bernie 
Sanders, not Hillary Clinton, not the greatest president you can possibly 
imagine can address the enormous problems facing the working families of our 
country by him or herself. That is the truth, and that is why we need a 
grassroots political movement in this country: a political revolution.

And that political revolution must work to elect candidates up and down the 
ballot, including members of Congress who are willing to stand up to 
corporate America and Wall Street. That’s why I am endorsing two 
progressives who have done that work throughout their careers: Congresswoman 
Marcy Kaptur and Congressman Rick Nolan.

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/kaptur-nolan?refcode=em160611-v2>Split another $15 contribution between our campaign and these two greatprogressive members of Congress and we will have the resources to continueour political revolution while providing critical support to the kind ofleaders we need in Congress.Congressman Rick Nolan (Minnesota) represents one of the most competitivecongressional districts in the country. Normally when that happens, theelected official moves to the “right” to protect their seat. Not Rick. Hiselection is a great opportunity to prove one can serve as a progressive andstill win a difficult race.Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur (Ohio) is a leading voice to adopt fair tradepolicies which not only raise wages in this country, but lift livingstandards throughout the world. She has been fighting for a fair tradepolicy from the day she came to Congress.I know that if you stand with them, as we have stood together throughoutthis campaign, we are almost certainly going to transform the DemocraticParty, and we are going to transform this country. <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/kaptur-nolan?refcode=em160611-v2> Split another $15 contribution between our campaign and these two greatprogressive members of Congress and we will have the resources to continueour political revolution while providing critical support to the kind ofleaders we need in Congress.From the very beginning, our campaign has been about building a movementwhich brings working people and young people together to create a governmentthat represents all of us, and not just a handful of wealthy campaigncontributors.Supporting Rick Nolan and Marcy Kaptur is an important extension of thatwork.In solidarity,Bernie SandersContribute<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/kaptur-nolan?refcode=em160611-v2>Paid for by Bernie 2016  <https://s.bsd.net/bernie16/main/page/-/website/billionaires.png>PO Box 905 - Burlington VT 05402 United States - (855) 4-BERNIEThis email was sent to rresendez@rigoresendez.com.
