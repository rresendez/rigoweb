Sisters and Brothers — The first question of tonight's debate got to the 
heart of our campaign. Lester Holt asked us, "How would you think big?"

This country faces more serious problems today than at any time since the 
Great Depression. Now is NOT the time for thinking small. Now is NOT the 
time for the same-old, same-old establishment politics and stale 
inside-the-beltway ideas.

If you are with me, contribute another $5 to help us win the Democratic 
nomination, the White House, and take back our country from the billionaire 
class. 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/m/24fb2aa1/43b7f9e2/429cdfb8/620ee5e4/9307972/VEsH/>

If we continue to stand together, we have the opportunity for our political 
revolution to achieve the goal of universal health care as a right for every 
man, woman, and child. When you’re sick and go to a doctor, you should not 
come out in bankruptcy.

We will break up the big banks, take on Wall Street, and make the economy 
work for everybody, not just a handful of millionaires and billionaires.

We will fight to reverse climate change. We will protect a woman's right to 
choose. We will make the minimum wage a living wage. We will make our 
communities safer from gun violence.

We will do all of this and more. But I can't take on the billionaire class 
alone. I need you to stand with me tonight. So I am asking you directly:

Contribute $5 to our campaign and show that you stand with our political 
revolution. 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/m/24fb2aa1/43b7f9e2/429cdfb8/620ee5e4/9307972/VEsE/>

Now is the time for millions of working families to come together, to 
revitalize American democracy, to end the collapse of the American middle 
class. We must make certain that our children and grandchildren are able to 
enjoy a quality of life that brings them health, prosperity, security and 
joy — and that once again makes the United States the leader in the world in 
the fight for economic and social justice, for environmental sanity and for 
a world of peace.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders
