Rigoberto -

When we started this campaign, I emailed my supporters and said, "This 
campaign is not about Bernie Sanders. It's about a grassroots movement of 
Americans standing up and saying: 'Enough is enough. This country and our 
government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.'"

I believe that now more than ever.

We still have a path to the nomination, and our plan is to win the pledged 
delegates in this primary. Next week five states vote, and there are A LOT 
of delegates up for grabs. I am going to keep fighting for every vote, for 
every delegate, because each is a statement of support for the values we 
share. That’s why I have to ask:

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/we-are-at-a-moment-of-truth?refcode=em160420-s1-full>Can I count on you to add a $15 contribution to our campaign – right now –to help us win this primary and as a way of saying you will never stopfighting for the ideas that have powered our political revolution?The truth is that if we stand together, there is no limit to what we canaccomplish. We can bring hope to the political process. We can make realchange. People should not underestimate us.In solidarity,Bernie SandersContribute<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/we-are-at-a-moment-of-truth?refcode=em160420-s1-full>  _____From: Bernie SandersDate: April 30, 2015Subject: Are you with me?Rigoberto -I am writing to inform you that I will be a candidate for President of theUnited States. I ask for your support. <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/we-are-at-a-moment-of-truth?refcode=em160420-s1-full> Add your $15 contribution in support of our campaign.For many months I have been traveling from coast to coast across ourcountry, and have had the opportunity to meet with thousands of good,hard-working, and remarkable people. Like you and me, they are deeplyconcerned about the future of our country.They wonder why they are working longer hours for lower wages. They worryabout whether their kids will be able to afford college or get decent jobs.They fear that they may not have the savings to retire with dignity andsecurity.The challenges facing our country are enormous.It's not just that, for forty years, the middle class has been disappearing.It's that 99% of all new income is going to the top 1%, and the grotesquelevel of wealth and income inequality today is worse than at any time sincethe late 1920s. The people at the top are grabbing all the new wealth andincome for themselves, and the rest of America is being squeezed and leftbehind.The disastrous decisions of the Supreme Court in the Citizens United caseand in other related decisions are undermining the very foundations ofAmerican democracy, as billionaires rig the system by using their Super PACsto buy politicians and elections.And the peril of global climate change, with catastrophic consequences, isthe central challenge of our times and our planet.The middle class in America is at a tipping point. It will not last anothergeneration if we don’t boldly change course now.After a year of travel, discussion and dialogue, I have decided to be acandidate for the Democratic nomination for president. But let's be clear.This campaign is not about Bernie Sanders. It's about a grassroots movementof Americans standing up and saying: "Enough is enough. This country and ourgovernment belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires." <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/we-are-at-a-moment-of-truth?refcode=em160420-s1-full> Our movement needs people like you involved to helpit succeed. Add your $15 contribution in support of our campaign.I run not to oppose any man or woman, but to propose new and far-reachingpolicies to deal with the crises of our times. And I run because I know wemust change course now, or risk losing the future for so many to theinterests of so few.A successful national campaign is a massive undertaking, especially when wewill be heavily outspent. It will require the active participation ofmillions of Americans in every community in our country. In fact, it willrequire nothing less than a political revolution which combats thedemoralization and alienation of so many of our people from the politicalprocess.Let me be very honest. It may be too late to stop the billionaire class fromtrying to buy the Presidency and Congress. The forces of greed already maybe too powerful.But we owe it to our children and grandchildren to try. We owe it to them tomake the fight and, through the power of our numbers, turn back this assaulton the foundation of our democracy and our future.We are at a moment of truth. We need to face up to the reality of where weare as a nation, and we need a mass movement of people to fight for change.I believe America is ready for a new path to the future.On May 26th I will formally launch our campaign at the City Hall inBurlington, Vermont, where I served as Mayor. <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/we-are-at-a-moment-of-truth?refcode=em160420-s1-full> I ask you to join with me in our campaign forPresident of the United States.Sincerely,Senator Bernie SandersContribute<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/we-are-at-a-moment-of-truth?refcode=em160420-s1-full-bot>Paid for by Bernie 2016  <https://s.bsd.net/bernie16/main/page/-/website/billionaires.png>PO Box 905 - Burlington VT 05402 United States - (855) 4-BERNIEThis email was sent to rresendez@rigoresendez.com.
