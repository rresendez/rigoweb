Rigoberto -

In the United States today, the wealthiest country in the history of the 
world, 47 million Americans are living in poverty.

Almost 22 percent of American children are poor and we have the highest 
child poverty rate of almost any major country on earth.

Let’s be clear. Living in poverty doesn’t just mean you don’t have enough 
money to buy a big screen TV, a fancy laptop, or the latest iPhone. It goes 
much deeper than that.

Living in poverty means you are less likely to have a good grocery store in 
your community selling healthy food. Far too often it means you don’t know 
where your next meal is going to come from. Living in poverty means you are 
less likely to have access to a doctor, dentist or mental health care 
provider. It means you have less access to public transportation, which 
makes it harder to find a job. It means you are less likely to have access 
to child care.

In the United States of America, poverty is often a death sentence.

Yesterday, I spoke about poverty in McDowell County, West Virginia — one of 
the poorest counties in one of the poorest states in America. In 2014, over 
35 percent of the residents in McDowell lived in poverty, including nearly 
half of the children. The roads are crumbling and only 6 percent of adults 
have a college education. Less than two-thirds have graduated high school. 
It has the lowest life expectancy for men in the entire nation. I hope you’ll 
watch part of my speech on poverty and share it with friends and family on 
social media.

Bernie Sanders Speaks on Poverty in McDowell County, West Virginia

<https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FqdWyOTvLg04&original_referer=https://go.berniesanders.com/page/share/poverty-is-a-death-sentence>

Poverty is an issue we must address. In 2011, the American Journal of Public 
Health found that 130,000 people died in just one year alone as a result of 
poverty.

This is not an issue we can just sweep under the rug and hope it will go 
away. Because it won’t.

And when I talk about it being too late for establishment politics and 
economics, this is what I mean. When I talk about thinking big and outside 
the box, about rejecting incremental change, I am talking about the millions 
of Americans who live in poverty who have been tossed out, left behind, and 
abandoned by the rich and powerful. We need to create an economy that works 
for all of us, not just the 1 percent.

Here’s what we need to do:

1.	Rebuild our country’s crumbling infrastructure. A $1 trillion investment 
in our infrastructure will create at least 13 million jobs all over 
America - jobs that cannot be outsourced.
2.	We must rewrite our disastrous trade policies that enable corporate 
America to shut down plans in places like West Virginia and move them to 
Mexico, China, and other low-wage countries.
3.	We can create 1 million jobs for disadvantaged youths through legislation 
I introduced with Rep. John Conyers of Michigan.
4.	We need to increase the wages of at least 53 million American workers by 
raising the minimum wage from a starvation wage of $7.25 an hour to $15 an 
hour.
5.	At a time when women workers earn 79 cents for every dollar a man earns, 
we need to sign the Paycheck Fairness Act into law. Equal pay for equal 
work.
6.	We need to make health care a right for every man, woman, and child 
through a Medicare for All single-payer system.
7.	We need to treat drug addiction like a mental health issue, not a 
criminal issue.
8.	We need to ensure every worker in this country has at least 12 weeks of 
paid family and medical leave, two weeks of paid vacation, and one week of 
paid sick days.
9.	We need to impose a tax on Wall Street to make public colleges and 
universities tuition free while substantially reducing student debt.
10.	At a time when half of older workers have no retirement savings, we’re 
not going to cut Social Security, we’re going to expand it so people can 
retire with dignity and respect.

No president can do all of these things alone. We need millions of Americans 
to begin to stand up and fight back and demand a government that represents 
all of us. That is the political revolution.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders
