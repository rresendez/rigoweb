Rigoberto -

Yesterday morning on Meet the Press, Bernie Sanders acknowledged that we 
have a "narrow path to victory," but that we are going to "fight through 
that path."

Tomorrow five states vote. They are big ones, and Bernie is campaigning 
hard. Last night, 14,000 people showed up to see him in New Haven, 
Connecticut. Earlier in the day, 7,000 came to see him in Providence, Rhode 
Island.

At every event, with crowds as large and excited as at any point in this 
campaign, people are telling Bernie to fight. To fight for every last 
delegate, and for every last vote — not just because they’re needed to win, 
but because each one sends an unmistakable message about our country’s need 
for transformational change.

So Bernie is going to fight, and he needs you with him, and that’s why we 
have to ask:
