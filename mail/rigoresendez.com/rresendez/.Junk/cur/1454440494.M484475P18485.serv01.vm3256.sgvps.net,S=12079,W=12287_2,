Rigoberto -

Tonight we accomplished what the corporate media and political establishment 
once believed was impossible: after trailing Hillary Clinton in Iowa 
throughout this entire campaign, it looks as if we will leave the state with 
roughly the same number of delegates.

I want to be clear with you about what this really means. Tonight’s result 
is a victory for our political revolution. We have proved that when people 
come together, anything is possible.

New Hampshire votes next, where we have a slight lead in the polls. If we 
win there, we’ll have all the momentum. What counts now is how we respond in 
this moment:

We were down 41percent in the polls… and those were some of the good ones. They said ourideas were radical and that we could never compete with the big-moneyfundraising of Hillary Clinton and her super PACs.Well, you showed them tonight.Victory is within our reach. But winning will require the activeparticipation of millions of Americans in every community across thecountry — nothing less than a political revolution.Please make a contribution to our campaign tonight: <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/how_we_respond?refcode=em160201> https://go.berniesanders.com/how_we_respondOn to New Hampshire.In solidarity,Bernie SandersContribute $5<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/how_we_respond?refcode=em160201>Paid for by Bernie 2016  <https://s.bsd.net/bernie16/main/page/-/website/billionaires.png>PO Box 905 - Burlington VT 05402 United States - (855) 4-BERNIEThis email was sent to rresendez@rigoresendez.com.
