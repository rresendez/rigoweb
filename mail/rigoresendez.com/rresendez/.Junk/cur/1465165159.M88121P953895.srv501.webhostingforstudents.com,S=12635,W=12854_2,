Rigoberto,

When we started our campaign, we had the support of hundreds of thousands of 
grassroots supporters beginning to build the movement that we know today. 
And the first member of Congress who saw the potential of our political 
revolution was Congressman Raúl Grijalva.

Raúl was the very first member of Congress to endorse our campaign, and he 
did so proudly. He is a progressive leader in Congress who's not afraid to 
stand up to the political establishment.

And now, as we enter the final primaries of the campaign, I will be 
campaigning in California with my friend Raúl Grijalva by my side once more. 
He is the exact kind of progressive hero we need in Congress, and that's 
why, with the polls so close, I need to ask you to help us win.

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/raul-grijalva?refcode=em160604-full>Split a $15 contribution between our campaign and Raúl Grijalva’sre-election, and we will have the resources we need to win in California onTuesday while supporting a great progressive leader we need in Congress.When we faced some of the most disingenuous attacks in our primary, it wasRaúl who was out in front with the media to defend our campaign. It was Raúlwho helped organized young Latinos in states across the country. And it'sRaúl's solid progressive vision that we need to continue to have inCongress.Every single poll in California shows it's going to be extremely close.That's why Raúl is spending the last days before this primary right by myside, earning every vote we can.We need your help now to win California, and Raúl needs your help to win hisre-election to Congress in November. <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/raul-grijalva?refcode=em160604-full> Split a $15 contribution between Bernie 2016 and Raúl Grijalva'sre-election campaign and help us both win.In solidarity,Bernie SandersContribute<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/raul-grijalva?refcode=em160604-full>Paid for by Bernie 2016  <https://s.bsd.net/bernie16/main/page/-/website/billionaires.png>PO Box 905 - Burlington VT 05402 United States - (855) 4-BERNIEThis email was sent to rresendez@rigoresendez.com.
