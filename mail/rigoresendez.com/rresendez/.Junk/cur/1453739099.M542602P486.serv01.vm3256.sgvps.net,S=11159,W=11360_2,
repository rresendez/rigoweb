Rigoberto -

When we first launched our campaign, the polls in Iowa showed us down 55 
points against Hillary Clinton. The political media laughed at us. They said 
our "radical ideas" would never attract much support against an "inevitable 
candidate."

But together we’ve built a campaign on the verge of accomplishing what 
everyone but us thought was impossible: winning the Democratic nomination 
for President of the United States.

The nominating contests begin one week from today with the Iowa Caucus where 
we are down just two points, but have the largest grassroots organization of 
any campaign.

And I know that if everyone like you who has already contributed to our 
campaign matched their previous donation today, there would be nothing the 
millionaires and billionaires funding the Clinton campaign and coordinated 
super PACs could do to stop us in Iowa:

The sameold establishment ideas won’t do. But charting a new course will require theactive participation of millions of Americans in every community in ourcountry.
