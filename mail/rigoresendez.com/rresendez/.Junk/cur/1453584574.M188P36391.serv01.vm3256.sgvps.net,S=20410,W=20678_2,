Please donate another$5, or whatever you can afford this week, to support our campaign beforeIowa voters caucus in less than two weeks.  _____Dear Rigoberto,Very little will ever get done until we reform our broken and corruptcampaign finance system. I hear about it everyday. The economic andpolitical systems in this country are stacked against ordinary Americans.The rich get richer and use their wealth to buy elections.Today is the sixth-year anniversary of Citizens United, one of the mostdisastrous Supreme Court decisions in my lifetime. This decision hinges onthe absurd notion that money is speech, that corporations are people, andthat giving huge piles of undisclosed cash in support of politicians inexchange for influence does not constitute corruption.In essence, this ruling handed millionaires and billionaires — who havealready rigged our economy — unlimited influence in our elections. It gavebillionaires like the Koch Brothers an even bigger opportunity to purchasethe House, the Senate, even the White House.Super PACs — a direct outgrowth of the Citizens United decision — areenabling the wealthiest people and the largest corporations in this countryto spend unlimited amounts on elections.We know, for example, that the Koch brothers, the second wealthiest familyin America, want to use the Citizens United decision to buy politiciansacross the country. This election cycle alone, they have committed to spendat least $750 million on political activities — an outrageous sum that iscorrupting our political process. And I can assure you, brothers andsisters, they won’t be spending that money with the interests of workingfamilies, women, and seniors in mind. That is simply unacceptable, and it’stime for the American people to rise up and reclaim our democracy. <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/m/24fb2d38/43b7f9e2/4355cb28/620e9df0/1429576725/VEsE/> Please contribute another $5 — or whatever you can afford —to help our growing movement repeal Citizens United and dismantle thiscorrupt campaign finance system. Together, one small-dollar contribution ata time, we will take our democracy back from the Koch brothers.Let’s be honest and acknowledge what we are talking about. We are talkingabout a rapid movement in this country towards a political system in which ahandful of very wealthy people and special interests will determine who getselected or who does not get elected. That is not what this country issupposed to be about. That was not Abraham Lincoln’s vision of a governmentof the people, by the people, and for the people.The need for real campaign finance reform is not a progressive issue. It isnot a conservative issue. It is an American issue. It is an issue thatshould concern all Americans, regardless of their political point of view,who wish to preserve the essence of the longest standing democracy in theworld — a government that represents all of the people and not a handful ofpowerful and wealthy special interests.Our campaign is doing so well because we are telling the truth about thereality of American life today. We are talking about a reality in which mostof the new wealth and income in this country are going to the top onepercent while working families are struggling more than at any point sincethe Great Depression.My vision for American democracy is a nation in which all people, regardlessof their income, can participate in the political process, and can run foroffice without begging for contributions from the wealthy and the powerful.While other politicians will make you the same promise, I am the onlycandidate running for the Democratic nomination who does not have a superPAC. And I am the only one who is telling the truth about the corruptinginfluence of Wall Street bankers and the obscenely wealthy in our elections.We have to create a political revolution where working Americans cometogether to say they have had ENOUGH of the billionaire class buying ourelections to enrich themselves while everyone else gets poorer. More thanever, we need a president who has a firm commitment to the American people —and no one else. <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/m/24fb2d38/43b7f9e2/4355cb28/620e9df0/1429576725/VEsF/> With less than two weeks until the Iowa caucus, I need yourhelp to win this election and reclaim our democracy. Can you pitch inanother $5 now to fuel our political revolution before voting begins?Our vision for democracy should be one in which candidates are speaking tothe vast majority of our people – working people, the middle class,low-income people, the elderly, the children, the sick, and the poor – anddiscussing with them their ideas as to how we can improve lives for allpeople in this country.I believe this vision of American can be a reality once again. We just haveto do something unprecedented in the coming months — defy the odds and winthe Democratic nomination for President of the United States.I am glad you are standing with us.In solidarity,Bernie SandersContribute $5<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/m/24fb2d38/43b7f9e2/4355cb28/620e9df0/1429576725/VEsC/>Paid for by Bernie 2016  <https://s.bsd.net/bernie16/main/page/-/website/billionaires.png>PO Box 905 - Burlington VT 05402 United States - (855) 4-BERNIEThis email was sent to rresendez@rigoresendez.com.
