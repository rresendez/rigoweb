Last night, while we were holding our largest rally of the campaign, a top 
Clinton surrogate told a much smaller audience that Hillary Clinton was 
under attack, and her supporters needed to "stand up and fight back, stand 
up against those idealists."

Let me tell you something, Rigoberto: there is nothing we have said in this 
campaign that is pie-in-the-sky, that is utopian. Nothing.

We are the wealthiest country in the history of the world, and we can create 
an economy where nobody who works 40 hours a week lives in poverty, where 
health care is a right for all Americans, and where kids of all backgrounds 
can go to college without crushing debt.

When we launched this campaign, I told everyone they should not 
underestimate us and that we were running to win. They thought we were 
pie-in-the-sky then, too. But tomorrow we have a chance to win yet again — 
in Hillary Clinton’s own backyard. I need you to continue to fight with me.

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/energy-intelligence-idealism?refcode=em160418-s1-full>You’ve already made a $15 contribution to our campaign. Matching that $15donation before midnight tonight will ensure we have the resources to winNew York and do very well in the five states voting one week from tomorrow.The energy, intelligence, and idealism of Americans, especially youngAmericans, have been the greatest agents for change in this country forgenerations. Those qualities have also powered our campaign from the start,and it’s also what is going to help us take this country back from thebillionaire class when we’re elected in November.
