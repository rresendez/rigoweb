Rigoberto -

For the first time in this race, one of the super PACs supporting Hillary 
Clinton’s campaign has placed a "six-figure" ad buy in Iowa, putting its 
thumb on the scale in her favor less than two weeks before the caucuses.

The super PAC is predictably funded by a number of millionaires and 
billionaires, including a former Goldman Sachs executive who "pioneered the 
trades that allowed the mega-bank to profit from the collapse of the housing 
market."

Our campaign doesn’t have a super PAC. We are backed by more than 2.5 
million individual small-dollar contributions and the largest volunteer 
operation in the race. And we’ve put ourselves in a position where we could 
overtake the Clinton campaign in Iowa. It’d be a tremendous shame if a super 
PAC is what took down Bernie in these closing days.
