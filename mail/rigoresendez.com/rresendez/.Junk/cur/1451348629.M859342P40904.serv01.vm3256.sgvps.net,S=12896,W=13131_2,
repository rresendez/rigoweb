Rigoberto -

When I first decided to run for president, my greatest fear was that if I 
were to run a poor campaign or did not do well, that it would be a setback 
not just for me, but for the ideas driving our campaign.

The corporate-owned media wrote us off. They said we had no chance of 
winning, that there was no way we could mobilize enough people to overcome 
the electoral influence of the billionaire class. The political 
establishment said victory was impossible.

But then we came along.

And in just a few months we’ve made history: we’re rising in the polls, we 
have more volunteers than any campaign, and have received more individual 
contributions than anyone ever at this point in the Democratic primary. Let 
me assure you, the alarm bells are going off among the corrupt corporate 
class which is used to buying elections with little resistance.

But with a little more than one month before the Iowa caucuses, we face our 
biggest test of the entire campaign so far: our final official FEC 
fundraising deadline of the year.
