Rigoberto -

The polls are about to close in five states, and we expect to do well in a 
number of them. As you watch the results, I want you to keep something very 
important in mind. We are running a historic campaign which is transforming 
America.

Any victories and any votes we receive tonight, next week in Indiana, and in 
each state moving forward are a public declaration of support for the values 
we share.

Our path to the nomination was never narrower than the day I announced my 
candidacy. I will not stop fighting for an America where no one who works 40 
hours a week lives in poverty, where health care is a right for all 
Americans, where kids of all backgrounds can go to college without crushing 
debt, where there is no bank too big to fail, no banker too powerful to 
jail, and we've reclaimed our democracy from the billionaire class.

The political establishment wants us to go away so they can begin their 
march to the center. But we can send a message to them in a language theyâ€™re 
sure to understand:

They said our ideas were too radical. But what we have donethroughout this campaign is show that when people stand together we can takeon a billionaire class and the candidates they fund.
