Rigoberto â€“

If you believe in what Bernie stands for, we need you to get on the phones 
and talk to some voters.

On Tuesday, 384 pledged delegates are at stake in five contests. We need to 
win as many of those delegates as possible to keep our movement going 
strong.

We've come from an afterthought in the polls, to where we are now, thanks to 
a lot of hard work from supporters just like you. So please join with 
thousands of other Bernie supporters across America, and put in a few hours 
today or tomorrow to call voters in the states voting Tuesday.

Yes, I'll call voters for Bernie now 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/content/april26/>

Yes, I can make some calls later 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/the-revolution-is-calling?source=em160424>

I can't call but I'll chip in $15
