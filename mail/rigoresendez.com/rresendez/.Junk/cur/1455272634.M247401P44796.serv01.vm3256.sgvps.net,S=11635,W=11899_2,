Rigoberto -

I just left the stage at the final debate before 14 caucuses and primaries 
take place over the next three weeks. And the message I sent to those who 
have yet to vote is that the American people cannot afford to wait for 
transformational change.

We’ve heard a lot of folks in the political establishment, and tonight on 
the stage, say that our ideas are too bold. That the best we can do right 
now is incremental change. But as my dear friend Senator Nina Turner has 
said, "the future of our country is too important to go from yes we can to 
no we can’t."

I think our campaign's message is why we left Iowa beating everyone’s 
expectations, won by huge margins in New Hampshire, and why we will do so 
well in the 14 contests over the next three weeks. But time is running out, 
and that’s why I have to ask you directly:

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/we-cant-wait?refcode=em160211> 
Make a $15 contribution to our campaign tonight and we will win the 
Democratic primary, the White House, and take our country back from the 
billionaire class.

The truth is, the forces aligned against us in this primary are too big and 
too powerful for any one candidate to take on alone. The only way we win is 
if we stand together. If we are divided, the big money interests will win.

These emails are how we fund this campaign, and that is why your 
contribution tonight is so important.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders
