Dear Rigoberto,

After our big wins in Indiana and West Virginia, Oregon and Kentucky are 
coming up this Tuesday. And if everyone who has signed up to support Bernie 
takes just an hour or two this weekend to call some voters, we stand a very 
good chance of winning both these states and keeping our momentum rolling 
into the June contests.

So we're calling for an all-hands-on-the-phones mobilization this weekend to 
identify Bernie supporters in the upcoming states, and get them out to vote. 
Can you help out?

Yes, I'll make some calls for Bernie this weekend 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/call-out-the-vote?source=em160512>

If you've never made phone calls to voters before, don't worry. It's pretty 
easy. All you need is a computer or a tablet, and a phone. There's a simple 
script for you to follow, and there are volunteers standing by on livechat 
to help if you get stuck.

We're going to keep fighting hard until the very end of this primary 
contest, because we know Bernie is by far the better candidate to defeat 
Trump in November. Every vote we win and delegate we claim sends an 
unmistakable message to the political establishment about the strength of 
our progressive agenda.

When we stand together, there is nothing we cannot accomplish. So we hope 
you'll continue fighting with us and keep this political revolution rolling 
strong â€“ all the way to the convention in Philadelphia.

Sign up to call some voters this weekend. 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/call-out-the-vote?source=em160512>

In solidarity,

Team Bernie

P.S. If you'd like to hear more about the importance of Kentucky, Oregon and 
our voter contact goals for the rest of the campaign, please join us on a 
special livestream event tomorrow <http://bernie.to/volstream>  (Friday) at 
6 pm ET/3 pm PT.



I can't volunteer, but I'll contribute
