Rigoberto,

I am writing you today to express my deep pride in the movement – the 
political revolution – you and I have created together over the last 15 
months. When we began this historic campaign, we were considered fringe 
players by the political, economic and media establishment. Well, we proved 
them wrong.

We showed that the American people support a bold, progressive agenda that 
takes on the billionaire class, that fights for racial, social, economic and 
environmental justice and that seeks to create a government that works for 
all of us and not just the big campaign donors.

We mobilized over 13 million voters across the country. We won 23 Democratic 
primary and caucus contests. We had literally hundreds of thousands of 
volunteers across the country. And we showed – in a way that can change 
politics in America forever – that you can run a competitive national 
grassroots campaign without begging millionaires and billionaires for 
campaign contributions.

Most importantly, we elevated the critical issues facing our country – 
issues the establishment has pushed under the rug for too long. We focused 
attention on the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality in this 
country and the importance of breaking up the large banks who brought our 
economy to the brink of collapse. We exposed our horrendous trade policies, 
our broken criminal justice system, and our people's lack of access to 
affordable health care and higher education. We fought aggressively to 
address the crisis of climate change, the need for real comprehensive 
immigration reform, the importance of developing a foreign policy that 
values diplomacy over war, and so much more.

We have shown throughout this election that these are issues that are 
important to voters and that progressive solutions energize people in the 
fight for real change. What we have accomplished so far is historic – but 
our work is far from over.

This movement of ours – this political revolution – must continue. We cannot 
let all of the momentum we have achieved in the fight to transform America 
be lost. We will never stop fighting for what is right.

It is true that in terms of winning the Democratic nomination, we did come 
up short. But this election was never about me or any candidate. It was 
about the powerful coming together of millions of people to take their 
country back from the billionaire class. That was the strength of our 
campaign and it will be the strength of our movement going forward in the 
months and years ahead.

In the coming weeks, I will be announcing the creation of successor 
organizations to carry on the struggle that we have been a part of these 
past 15 months. I hope you will continue to be involved in fighting to 
transform America. Our goal will be to advance the progressive agenda that 
we believe in and to elect like-minded candidates at the federal, state and 
local levels who are committed to accomplishing our goals.

In terms of the presidential election this November, there is no doubt that 
the election of Donald Trump as president would be a devastating blow to all 
that we are fighting for. His openly bigoted and pro-billionaire campaign 
could precipitate the same decades-long rightward shift in American politics 
that happened after the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980. That rightward 
shift after Reagan’s election infected not just politics as a whole but led 
to the ascendancy of the corporatist wing of the Democratic Party – an era 
from which we are still recovering.

I cannot in good conscience let that happen.

To have all of the work we have done in elevating our progressive ideals be 
dashed away by a complete Republican takeover of Washington – a takeover 
headed by a candidate that demonizes Latinos, Muslims, women, African 
Americans, veterans, and others – would be unthinkable.

Today, I endorsed Hillary Clinton to be our next president. I know that some 
of you will be disappointed with that decision. But I believe that, at this 
moment, our country, our values, and our common vision for a transformed 
America, are best served by the defeat of Donald Trump and the election of 
Hillary Clinton.

You should know that in the weeks since the last primary, both campaigns 
have worked together in good faith to bridge some of the policy issues that 
divided us during the election. Did we come to agreement on everything? Of 
course not. But we made important steps forward.

Hillary Clinton released a debt free college plan that we developed together 
which now includes free tuition at public colleges and universities for 
working families. This was a major part of our campaign’s agenda and a 
proposal that, if enacted into law, would revolutionize higher education in 
this country.

Secretary Clinton has also publicly committed to massive investments in 
health care for communities across this country that will increase primary 
care, including mental health care, dental care, and low-cost prescription 
drug access for an additional 25 million people. Importantly, she has also 
endorsed the enactment of a so-called public option to allow everyone in 
this country to participate in a public insurance program. This idea was 
killed by the insurance industry during consideration of President Obama’s 
health care program.

During the Democratic platform proceedings in St. Louis and Orlando, we were 
victorious in including amendments to make it a clear priority of the 
Democratic Party to fight for a $15 an hour federal minimum wage, expand 
Social Security, abolish the death penalty, put a price on carbon, establish 
a path toward the legalization of marijuana, enact major criminal justice 
reforms, pass comprehensive immigration reform, end for-profit prisons and 
detention facilities, break up too-big-to-fail banks and create a 21st 
century Glass-Steagall Act, close loopholes that allow big companies to 
avoid taxes by stashing their cash in offshore tax havens and use that 
revenue to rebuild America, approve the most expansive agenda ever for 
protecting Native American rights and so much more.

All of these progressive policies were at the heart of our campaign. The 
truth is our movement is responsible for the most progressive Democratic 
platform in the history of our country. All of that is the direct result of 
the work that our members of the platform committee did in the meetings and 
that you have been doing over the last 15 months.

But none of these initiatives will happen if we do not elect a Democratic 
president in November. None! In fact, we will go backward. We must elect the 
Democratic nominee in November and progressive Democrats up and down the 
ballot so that we ensure that these policy commitments can advance.

It is extremely important that we keep our movement together, that we hold 
public officials accountable and that we elect progressive candidates to 
office at the federal, state, and local level who will stand with us.

As part of that effort, we still have a tremendous amount of work left to do 
in the Democratic Rules Committee that will be meeting in the coming weeks. 
We have to enact the kinds of reforms to the Democratic Party and to the 
electoral process that will provide us the tools to elect progressive 
candidates, to allow new voices and new energy into the Party, and to break 
up the excessive power that the economic and political elites in the Party 
currently have. As with our fights on the platform committee, that will only 
be possible if we stand together.

You should know that I intend to be actively campaigning throughout this 
election season to elect candidates who will stand by our agenda. I hope to 
see many of you at events from coast to coast.

In conclusion, I again want to express my pride in what we have accomplished 
together over the last year. But so much more must be done to make our 
vision a reality. Now more than ever our country needs our movement – our 
political revolution. As you have throughout this historic campaign, I ask 
for your ongoing support as we continue through the fall and beyond.

On a personal note, I cannot say with words how appreciative Jane and I are 
of the kindness, dedication and love we experienced from so many people 
across the country. We are deeply touched by it and will never, ever forget 
it.
