Rigoberto,

We are at a critical moment for the future of the Democratic Party and our 
country. Last night marked the last primary as part of the Democratic 
nomination process, and we know that our campaign will enter the convention 
in Philadelphia with more than 1800 delegates.

Our movement has fought against steep odds when so many people counted us 
out. Together we built a political revolution that fought in every one of 
more than 50 primaries and caucuses since February. Our delegates from this 
movement will be the people who vote on the platform of the Democratic 
Party, and who will have influence on not just who the nominee is this 
election, but how the next nominee will be elected, too.

The future of our political revolution depends on you. That's why Bernie 
Sanders will host a live, online video address this Thursday night at 8:30 
p.m. EDT / 5:30 p.m. PDT. Will you join Bernie?

 <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/live?source=em160615> Sign up to RSVP 
to watch Bernie Sanders' live, online video message on Thursday night and we’ll 
send you a text message or email shortly before the event begins.

RSVP TO JOIN  <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/live?source=em160615> »

Our political revolution is not just about what happens in Philadelphia, or 
even at the election in November, during which we must stop Donald Trump 
from becoming president. In order for the work that we have begun to be 
long-lasting for years to come, we must continue our political revolution. 
And we need you to be a part of it.

We'll see you Thursday night.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver
Campaign Manager
Bernie 2016
