Rigoberto,

The corporate interests are at it again. Monsanto, agribusiness and the 
bio-tech industry have spent hundreds of millions of dollars trying to 
overturn legislation passed by Vermont, Connecticut, Maine and Alaska that 
calls for the labeling of GMO food. In fact, they are moving aggressively 
now because Vermont's strong law goes into effect today.

This legislation is important because people have a right to know what is in 
the food they and their children eat. The more information we have, the 
better consumers we become. This is not a radical idea. It is why over 60 
countries around the world have passed GMO labeling laws.

Unfortunately, the major agribusiness and bio-tech companies disagree. They 
do not believe people have a right to know what's in the food they eat. That 
is why they have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in lobbying and 
campaign contributions to overturn the GMO right-to-know legislation that 
states have already passed and that many other states are on the verge of 
passing.

A bill in the Senate would overrule Vermont's law, and prevent states from 
passing similar laws. This bill, introduced by Senators Pat Roberts (R-KS) 
and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) will be coming up for a vote on Wednesday or 
Thursday of next week. It must be defeated.

And, if wedon't stop them, they may just succeed.On Thursday evening, with no hearings and no debate, a corporate-backed billwas introduced on to the floor by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.This legislation would create a confusing, misleading and unenforceablenational standard for labeling GMOs. Instead of a uniform labeling standardlike Vermont’s law, the language allows text, symbols, or an electronic codeto be used. This is intentionally confusing to consumers, and theinformation may be entirely inaccessible if the consumer does not haveaccess to the internet.Perhaps most shockingly, this bill imposes no penalties whatsoever forviolating the labeling requirement, making the law essentially meaningless.Thus, this is a weak bill, full of loopholes, without any requirement tocomply.The issue of labeling our food isn’t controversial. The overwhelmingmajority of Americans favor GMO labeling. People have a right to know whatis in the food they eat. The Senate shouldn't stop states from passing lawsthat let that happen.Congress must stand up to the demands of Monsanto and other multi-nationalfood industry corporations and reject this outrageous, weak, and confusingbill. I will continue to do my best to defeat it, and take the necessaryaction to protect Vermont’s GMO labeling efforts. But I need you with me inorder to ensure its defeat. <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/speakout/stop-the-gmo-labeling-bill?source=em160701> Click here to write to your senators today and say that youwant them to oppose this GMO labeling bill.
