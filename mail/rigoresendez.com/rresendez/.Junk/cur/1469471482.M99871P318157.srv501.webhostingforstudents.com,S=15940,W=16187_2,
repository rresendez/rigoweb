Rigoberto,

Thank you for everything you have done for the Political Revolution.

As you know, our campaign has always been about a grassroots movement of 
Americans standing up and saying: "Enough is enough. This country and our 
government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires."

Tonight I'm going to speak to the Democratic National Convention about all 
that we did together in our campaign, about the future of our country, and 
about the need for our grassroots movement to continue the struggle.

 <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/convention-speech?refcode=em160725-full>Say you'll watch my address tonight to the Democratic National Convention.I hope you'll tune in. It will be a very important address that will talkabout not just why we must defeat Donald Trump, the worst presidentialcandidate in the modern history of our country, but how we will worktogether beyond this election to continue our political revolution.What we have accomplished so far is nothing short of astonishing. When webegan our campaign we were considered "fringe" and irrelevant by the punditsand the media. Well, 13 million votes later it appears that we have begunthe process of transforming our country and radically changing the politicallandscape. We have made history, and you helped make that happen.Taking on virtually the entire political establishment, you helped us winprimary and caucus elections in 23 contests and send nearly 1900 delegatesto this Democratic convention. In a race in which everyone expected us to beoutraised and outspent, you made more grassroots contributions than anyprimary campaign ever and proved that we could run a presidential campaignwithout begging millionaires and billionaires for money. Some of thewealthiest people in the world were prepared to spend billions of dollars tostop you.You built a grassroots organization that rivals anything seen before in ourcountry, knocking on millions of doors, making tens of millions of phonecalls, and building immense power in your communities.You brought the issues of universal healthcare, combating climate change,free college tuition, a $15 minimum wage, and so many more progressiveissues to the forefront of the race for president.But you did more than just make those issues part of the debate – you havechanged the policy platform of the Democratic Party and of Secretary HillaryClinton's campaign.Because of our tireless work the Democratic Party has just passed the mostprogressive platform, by far, in the history of the party. Secretary Clintonnow says that she will oppose the disastrous Trans Pacific Partnership tradedeal. She has also embraced parts of our plan to make college tuition free –and if her new plan passes, it could revolutionize the way higher educationis funded in our country. Secretary Clinton has also embraced the publicoption for health insurance, and now supports significantly increasedfunding for community health centers. She adopted these positions because ofyou and your organizing.It is critically important that we do not let up in our fight for apolitical revolution. Tonight at the Democratic National Convention I willaddress the future of Our Revolution, and I hope you will both tune in towatch, and join our effort after.Thank you for being a part of the continued political revolution.In solidarity,Bernie SandersI'll Watch the Speech<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/convention-speech?refcode=em160725-full> »Paid for by Bernie 2016  <https://s.bsd.net/bernie16/main/page/-/website/billionaires.png>PO Box 905 - Burlington VT 05402 United States - (855) 4-BERNIEThis email was sent to rresendez@rigoresendez.com.
