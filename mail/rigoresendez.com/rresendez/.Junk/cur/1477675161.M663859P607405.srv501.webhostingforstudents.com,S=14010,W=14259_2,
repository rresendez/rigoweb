Rigoberto,

All across our country, as a result of the disastrous Supreme Court decision 
on Citizens United, billionaires are trying to buy elections for candidates 
who will represent the wealthy and the powerful.

There is no better example of this than in Wisconsin, where big money 
interests are spending millions to defeat progressive champion Russ 
Feingold. Russ, throughout his career, has led the effort for campaign 
finance reform, civil rights, the protection of our privacy and the needs of 
working people. He opposed the war in Iraq, led the effort against the 
Patriot Act and wants to see that the wealthy and large corporations pay 
their fair share of taxes.

It should be no surprise, therefore, that the Koch Brothers and the 
billionaire class want to keep Russ out of the Senate. The problem is, 
they're spending so much money in Wisconsin's Senate race that Russ could 
lose.

The billionaire class has already spent $7.5 million in outside spending to 
defeat Russ. He's seen his lead in the polls cut by more than half.

In my mind, this is exactly the kind of grotesque spending by millionaires 
and billionaires which is moving our country toward an oligarchic form of 
society. We need to overturn Citizens United, we need real campaign finance 
reform, and we need a progressive Senate.

We need to help Russ Feingold win his election, and that means all of us 
need to stand together right now to support Russ.

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/russ-feingold?refcode=em161028-full>Please rush a $15 contribution DIRECTLY to Russ Feingold's campaign so thathe can take on the billionaires trying to keep him out of the Senate.It is absolutely critical for Russ Feingold to win his election if we wantto win a majority of seats in the Senate.
