Dear Rigoberto,

About two decades ago, long before I ever imagined I would campaign for the 
presidency, I wrote a book titled Outsider in the House about how we used 
the authority extended from my electoral victories to make changes for the 
better in the lives of people who don’t have many allies in positions of 
power.

My decision to run for president was inspired by the events outlined in that 
book, and if you really want to understand what this campaign is about and 
how we will leverage our political revolution to create real change after I’m 
elected, then you should read it.

Because I think it’s important, I want to try something pretty wild here:

 <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/m/24fb281a/43b7f9e2/4ba89074/62139f59/2599403770/VEsH/>For a very limited time, make a contribution to our campaign — of anyamount — and we’ll send you a recently released updated version of my book,now titled Outsider in the White House.The average contribution Bernie supporters make for the book is $27.64. <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/m/24fb281a/43b7f9e2/4ba89074/62139f59/2599403770/VEsE/>This book is not the story of easy or steady success — it is a story ofstruggle and hard work. It’s about a little progress in the right directionand then a setback; it’s about election defeats and election wins, and it’sabout breakthroughs that few of us had imagined possible ... until theyhappened.I hope you’ll take me up on this offer.In solidarity,Bernie Sanders <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/m/24fb281a/43b7f9e2/4ba89074/62139f59/2599403770/VEsF/>Paid for by Bernie 2016  <https://s.bsd.net/bernie16/main/page/-/website/billionaires.png>PO Box 905 - Burlington VT 05402 United States - (855) 4-BERNIEThis email was sent to rresendez@rigoresendez.com.
