Dear Rigoberto,

This campaign has always been about winning. We set out to build a political 
movement and organize massive voter turnout necessary for victory. With your 
help we're doing just that — organizing in record numbers in every state in 
the nation.

As a result — and to the disbelief of the corporate media and the political 
establishment — Bernie is on the verge of scoring historic upsets in Iowa 
and New Hampshire.

On January 23, Bernie wants to deliver a live video message to you, his 
hardest working supporters. With just a week before the Iowa caucus, 
followed soon after by the New Hampshire primary, it will be time to get 
focused with laser precision on the work necessary to pull off victory in 
the early states and beyond.

Whether it's at home with a few friends or in a public venue with a few 
hundred, will you help organize this giant event for Bernie?

Yes, I will host an event for Bernie's 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/m/24fb2bad/43b7f9e2/44772c74/620f8064/4123757156/VEsH/> 
address on January 23!

I can't host, but I 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/m/24fb2bad/43b7f9e2/44772c74/620f8065/4123757156/VEsE/>
want to watch
on January 23.

Democrats will win the 2016 presidential election if massive numbers of 
voters turn out, including voters who too often sit out on Election Day. 
Bernie, backed by millions of active supporters, is our best chance for 
winning the White House.

The inspiring work you've been doing to share Bernie's message with voters 
has put victory within reach. But if we're going to help Bernie win the 
nomination there's much more to do.

Bernie is going to lay that out for us on January 23. Whether it's at a 
local theater, library meeting room, pub, or a volunteer's living room, 
Bernie wants to talk to you at 6 PM Eastern / 5 PM Central / 3 PM Pacific.

We want as many supporters as possible to have a chance to gather with 
fellow volunteers and hear Bernie's message.

There will be a live stream for you to tune into to hear Bernie deliver a 
special message directly to supporters. If you can host an event — either at 
a public venue or at your home — we need you to get more info and sign up 
today.

If you can't host an event, please save the date and we'll be sending you 
information soon about events near you.

Yes, I will host an event for Bernie's nationwide address to supporters on 
January 23. 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/m/24fb2bad/43b7f9e2/44772c74/620f8064/4123757156/VEsF/>

Or,

I can't host an event, but I want to watch Bernie's special address to 
supporters on January 23. 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/m/24fb2bad/43b7f9e2/44772c74/620f8065/4123757156/VEsC/>

The impossible is within reach — and Bernie is going to explain what he 
needs us to do to bring victory home in key early contests. Please save the 
date for an important address from Bernie at a crucial moment in this 
historic campaign.

In solidarity,

Becky Bond
Bernie 2016
