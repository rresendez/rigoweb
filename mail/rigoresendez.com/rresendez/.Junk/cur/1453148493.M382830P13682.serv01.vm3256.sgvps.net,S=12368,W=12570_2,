They said our “radical” ideaswould never attract much support.Months later, we have the largest grassroots base of support of anycampaign, and are now on the verge of overtaking the “inevitable”frontrunner in Iowa.I think the reason our campaign is doing so well is because Bernie istelling the truth. He’s telling the truth about the best way to providehealth care for the 29 million of our neighbors who are still without, andabout a rigged economy held in place by corrupt politics where Wall Streetbanks and billionaires buy elections.In just a few hours, Bernie will take the stage for the final debate beforethe Iowa caucuses, where we trail by just three points. This is a big nightfor our campaign, and Bernie is ready. <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/m/24fb2ab6/43b7f9e2/42b15bda/620ef864/2499313058/VEsE/> Show your love for Bernie with a $5 contribution beforetonight’s debate.
