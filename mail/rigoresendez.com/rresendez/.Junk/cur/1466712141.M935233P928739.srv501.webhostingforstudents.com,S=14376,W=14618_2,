Rigoberto,

A big reason for our tremendous success throughout our campaign has been 
because we have clearly articulated a vision for the future of America that 
encompasses social justice, economic justice, racial justice, and 
environmental justice.

This vision is not only what I want — it's what the 12 million Americans who 
voted for a political revolution want. You want real change in this country, 
you want it now and are prepared to take on the political cowardice and 
powerful special interests which have prevented that change from happening.

One place we think the agenda of these 12 million Americans should be 
reflected is in the official platform of the Democratic Party.

 <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/Democratic-party-platform?source=em160623-full>What issues do you want to be the focus of the Democratic Party platform?Tell us the issues you think should be included.TELL US YOUR DEMOCRATIC PARTY PLATFORM PRIORITIES<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/Democratic-party-platform?source=em160623-full> »We aren't afraid to think big, and our agenda shows it. It is possible totransform America into a country that unquestionably works for workingfamilies and not the billionaire class. Together, we have called for a $15minimum wage, a Medicare-for-all single payer health care system, breakingup the big banks, free tuition at public colleges, a ban on fracking, acarbon tax, and so much more.The platform matters because it is a document that enshrines the values andgoals of the Democratic Party. It's a document to which we can point andsay, "This is what we believe, and this is what we fight for."And so the Democratic Party has a choice in the coming weeks, and thatchoice is whether or not to embrace a bold, fearless, progressive platformthat has the potential to transform our country for generations.We need to hear from you about what you think the most important issues arethat should be included in the platform. <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/Democratic-party-platform?source=em160623-full> Tell us what you think should be the priorities of the DemocraticParty's platform.We're taking our campaign, our values, and our movement to the Democraticconvention in Philadelphia. We're excited to bring your thoughts on theparty platform too.
