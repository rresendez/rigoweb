Let's talk about the state of the race as it stands today, Rigoberto. For us 
to win the majority of pledged delegates, we need to win 654 out of the 
remaining 1,061.

That is 64 percent. It is admittedly a tough hill to climb, but not an 
impossible one. We intend to fight for every vote and delegate remaining, 
starting with tomorrow night's primary in Indiana where recent polling shows 
us well with the margin of error.

NBC - Indiana Primary (April 29)
Clinton: 50%
Sanders: 46%

Winning Indiana tomorrow night would not only cut into Secretary Clinton's 
lead, but it would send a powerful message to the political establishment 
and corporate media who just want this race to end so they can get on with 
the ratings and fundraising bonanza that would be a Clinton v. Trump general 
election. But Bernie is going to keep fighting, and that's why we have to 
ask:

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/indiana-poll?refcode=em160502-s1>Adding one more $15 contribution before Indiana votes tomorrow night willhelp us win a very important state while sending a powerful message that youare in this campaign as long as Bernie continues to fight.Let's be clear. It is virtually impossible for Secretary Clinton to win allof the pledged delegates she needs to capture the nomination without thehelp of superdelegates at the convention. That means every vote we receive,every delegate we win between now and July strengthens our hand as we get toa contested convention.Indiana's next.
