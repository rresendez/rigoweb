Rigoberto -

Coming out of last night's results, in which we won Rhode Island but came up 
short in four others, I want to pose to you three things that I know to be 
true:

1.	Young people – the future of our country – continue to vote for our 
campaign in overwhelming numbers. It's remarkable, and honestly quite 
humbling.

2.	When we compete in open primaries that encourage the participation of 
independents, new voters, and young people, we do very well.

3.	What remains in front of us is a very narrow path to the nomination. In 
the weeks to come we will be competing in a series of states that are very 
favorable to us – including California. Just like after March 15 – when we 
won 8 of the next 9 contests – we are building tremendous momentum going 
into the convention.

That is the reality of where we are right now, and why we are going to fight 
for every delegate and every vote. It is why I am going to continue to speak 
to voters in every state about the very important issues facing our country. 
Our country cannot afford to stop fighting for a $15 minimum wage, to 
overturn Citizens United, or to get universal health care for every man, 
woman, and child in America.

I'm asking you to help me continue to lead these fights. We have an FEC 
deadline on Saturday and another primary on Tuesday. Every vote we earn and 
every delegate we win is a testament to our ideas, to our movement, to our 
political revolution, and our willingness to take this campaign for the 
Democratic nomination all the way to the convention.

Your support right nowbefore two big deadlines will send an unmistakable message that our voiceswill still be heard.There is no doubt in my mind that what you and I have done together up tothis point is nothing short of historic.
