Rigoberto,

Last week, when we asked for 15,000 of you to call New York, we honestly 
weren't sure if we could hit that target. But Sunday night when we ran the 
numbers, we found that you smashed through our original goal of two million 
calls, and put more than THREE million calls into New York 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/content/nyphonebank/>  in just two days.

That is simply incredible! And it could make a huge difference today. But we 
can't stop now. Despite a ton of on-the-ground momentum, Bernie is still 
down a few points in the polls this morning as New Yorkers head out to vote.

URGENT: we need 7,500 of you on the phones for one hour today 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/content/nyphonebank/>  to make sure 
Bernie supporters in New York get out to vote. If 7,500 of you get on the 
phones for at least one hour, we'll put another million calls into New York 
when it counts the most â€“ on primary day.

YES, I WILL CALL BERNIE SUPPORTERS NOW TO HELP WIN NEW YORK 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/content/nyphonebank/>

 <https://go.berniesanders.com/page/content/nyphonebank/>

An upset victory in New York would be game-changing for this primary and 
this movement, and put us on a path to win the nomination and the White 
House. We know we have the grassroots support to pull it off, but the 
critical challenge is getting Bernie's supporters to the polls. Your calls 
today could literally mean the difference between winning and losing 
tonight.

Call New Yorkers now and help turn Bernie supporters out to vote. 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/content/nyphonebank/>

In solidarity,

Team Bernie
