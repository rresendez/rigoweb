Sign up to help call a quarter of a million Texans on Sunday.

Rigoberto -

This election remains a steep uphill climb.

The billionaire class is spending big to defeat us. The corporate media is 
ignoring us. The establishment is putting its thumb on the scale and trying 
to rig the game against us.

But despite the enormous barriers in our way, we can win – because this isn’t 
a political campaign, it’s a mass movement of millions of people.

On Sunday, January 10, we’re going to prove it. We’re organizing a mass, 
coordinated, statewide day of action. Our incredibly ambitious goal is to 
make a quarter of a million phone calls to Texans in one day.

I’m not going to lie: That’s crazy, and we might not be able to do it. But 
if all of us show up on Sunday and give Bernie two hours of our time, we’ll 
blow through that massive goal.

Will you attend a nearby phone bank and make calls for Bernie on Sunday? 
Here’s an event near you:

What: Texas day of action phone banking party
Where: McAllen Public Library
4001 N. 23rd St. McAllen
McAllen, TX 78504
When: Sunday, January 10ᵗʰ
1:00 pm CST

Look, we might fall short of our goal on Sunday. We can only make a quarter 
of a million calls if literally thousands of volunteers turn out to phone 
banks across the state. Even though lots of Texans have already signed up to 
join the day of action, we still need a lot more.

That’s why I need you to step up right now. If we all work together, we can 
do something momentous on Sunday and send a simple, clear message to the 
political and economic establishment: You can’t stop our political 
revolution.
