We talk a lot about the average contribution to our campaign, Rigoberto. Do 
you know what it is?

It's $27. (Of course you knew that. It's just so fun to say.)

We think $27 is so important because it stands in such stark contrast to how 
seemingly everyone else runs for president: huge contributions from the 
billionaire class, lobbyists bundling hundreds of thousands of dollars, or, 
as Hillary Clinton is doing tonight, hosting dinners with a top price tag of 
$353,400.

So while Hillary Clinton is hosting her $353,400 dinner tonight in San 
Francisco, we're running an ad on TV to tell San Francisco voters that we do 
things differently. It's called "$27."

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/27-ad?refcode=em160415-sub-b> 
Watch our new ad about how our campaign is powered by $27 contributions, and 
chip in your own $27 to continue this critical work to challenge our corrupt 
campaign finance system.

Watch the ad 
<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/27-ad?refcode=em160415-sub-b>
& chip in $27

It seems like everyone knows what our average contribution is. Even at last 
night's debate, the audience shouted "TWENTY SEVEN DOLLARS" before Bernie 
could finish his sentence about the average contribution to our campaign.

More than 2 million people have contributed almost 7 million times because 
they want to make Bernie Sanders our next president. At an average of $27 
apiece, we are showing that there is another way to run campaigns – one that 
cuts out the billionaire class. They don't like that very much, and that's 
why they're trying to stop us.

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/27-ad?refcode=em160415-sub-b> 
Contribute $27 to our campaign right now to show the political and financial 
establishment that we can compete with their corrupt campaign finance 
system – and that we can win.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver
Campaign Manager
Bernie 2016
