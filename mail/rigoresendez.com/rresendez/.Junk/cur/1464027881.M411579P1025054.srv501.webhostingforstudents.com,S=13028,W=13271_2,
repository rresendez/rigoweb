Rigoberto -

The political revolution is not just about electing a president. We need a 
Congress with members who believe, like Bernie, that we cannot change a 
corrupt system by taking its money.

So let me introduce you to Tim Canova, a progressive challenger who is 
running against Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz in a Democratic primary in 
Florida this year.

Tim endorsed Bernie’s presidential campaign, and was inspired to run because 
of Wasserman Schultz’ support of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. His campaign 
is funded like ours, by lots of people giving small amounts of money.

And on issues like taking on Wall Street, making tuition free at public 
colleges, and reforming our broken campaign finance system, he is someone 
you can be proud to support. That's why Bernie is endorsing Tim's campaign, 
and why we’re proud to ask:

Your support changed their racesovernight. In the days ahead, we’re going to add a dozen or more additionalcandidates to that list.We’re doing this because it is too late for establishment politics andestablishment economics. We need real change.
