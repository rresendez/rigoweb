Dear Rigoberto,

The LA Times came out with some very interesting news on Friday: 
California's voter rolls swelled by more than 650,000 new voters right 
before the registration deadline. This presents us with a golden 
opportunity – we think a big percentage of those new voters are ready to 
support Bernie.

Needless to say, winning California would be a yuuuge boost for our 
movement. We've come from more than 50 points down when we started, to a 
statistical tie in the latest polls. So now, it all depends on turnout.

Our staff and volunteers in California are fired up and working virtually 
around the clock to get all Bernie's supporters to the polls on Tuesday. Can 
you help out on the phones for an hour or two?

Yes, I'll make some calls before election day 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/win-more-states-for-bernie?source=em160605-full>

If you've never made calls for Bernie before, now is the time to step up. 
It's not a complicated process, and we'll give you all the instructions you 
need to make these important calls. Californians are very receptive to 
Bernie's progressive message, and if we can pull off a victory there 
Tuesday, you'll know you played an important role at this pivotal moment of 
American political history.

We're fighting hard to win California since it's the final and – with 475 
pledged delegates up for grabs – biggest state on the primary calendar. A 
strong showing there will give the superdelegates something very important 
to think about as they consider who will be the strongest nominee against 
Trump in the fall.

So we hope you can pitch in a couple hours of your time between now and 
Tuesday 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/win-more-states-for-bernie?source=em160605> 
to keep our political revolution rolling strong all the way to the 
convention in Philadelphia.

In solidarity,

Team Bernie

P.S. Download our new Bernie Messenger app

remind them to vote for Bernie on Tuesday!
