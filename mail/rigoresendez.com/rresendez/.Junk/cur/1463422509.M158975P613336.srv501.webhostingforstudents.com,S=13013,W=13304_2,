Dear Rigoberto -

Our victories in Indiana and West Virginia showed the entire nation that our 
political revolution is still going strong. Kentucky and Oregon are voting 
tomorrow, and there are a lot of delegates at stake.

Our in-state staff and volunteers have been working very hard for the past 
few weeks, but they need your help in these last two days to get out the 
vote. There are thousands of voters in both of these states we just can’t 
reach with a door knock. A call from a friendly Bernie volunteer may be all 
that’s needed to get them out to vote. Will you help us make some of those 
calls?

YES, I CAN CALL VOTERS FOR BERNIE NOW 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/call-now-3>

YES, SIGN ME UP TO MAKE CALLS LATER 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/call-later-3>

If you’ve never made these GOTV calls before, don’t worry – they’re pretty 
simple. Our Bernie Dialer does all the hard work of dialing numbers for you, 
and efficiently connects you to the voters we're targeting. You just need to 
follow the script we provide, figure out if someone is a Bernie supporter, 
and if so, help them make a plan to get their vote in for Bernie on Tuesday.

Rigoberto, our campaign’s unique strength is the amazing power of collective 
action by millions of grassroots volunteers just like you. When we focus 
this voter contact machine on just a couple of states, the results can be 
pretty amazing.

You’ll probably be watching election returns tomorrow night – and your 
efforts in the next 36 hours or so will directly influence the results that 
the world sees. Imagine the boost in momentum that a pair of wins tomorrow 
could deliver for our political revolution. Please help make that happen by 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/call-now-3> making some calls now, or by 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/call-later-3> signing up for a call shift 
later today or tomorrow.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver
Campaign Manager
Bernie 2016
