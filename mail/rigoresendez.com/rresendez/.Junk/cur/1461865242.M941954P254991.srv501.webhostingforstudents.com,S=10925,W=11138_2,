Rigoberto -

You may not have noticed this, but the bottom of every email we’ve sent 
since the beginning of this campaign has included the words, "Paid for By 
Bernie 2016." And beneath those, "(not the billionaires)."

Bernie doesn’t go around hustling millionaires and billionaires for money. 
Never has. Never will. Can you even imagine the reaction he’d get if he 
tried?

Our campaign to win this primary and transform the Democratic Party has 
always been powered by the people who make up our political revolution. And 
when you see us winning states and capturing large numbers of delegates 
before the convention, it’s requests like this that make it possible. So we 
have to ask:
