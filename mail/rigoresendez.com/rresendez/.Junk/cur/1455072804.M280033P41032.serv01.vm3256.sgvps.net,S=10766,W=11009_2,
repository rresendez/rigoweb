Rigoberto -

We just won the New Hampshire primary.

I am about to head downstairs to address an enthusiastic group of supporters 
and volunteers. But what I am about to tell you is important:

There are 14 primaries and caucuses over the next three weeks, and you can 
be certain that our victory tonight will prompt a desperate response from 
the nationâ€™s financial elite and the political establishment who want to 
stop our campaign to transform America.

Who knows what they're going to throw at us next. All I know is we must be 
ready to respond, organize, and win.

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/we-won-NH?refcode=em160209> 
Make a $5 contribution to our campaign tonight and we are going to win this 
Democratic primary, the White House, and take our country back from the 
billionaire class.

Nine months ago, if you told somebody that we would win the New Hampshire 
primary, they would not have believed you. Not at all. Too bold, they would 
have said. Not enough money to compete against the billionaires.

You showed them tonight.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders
