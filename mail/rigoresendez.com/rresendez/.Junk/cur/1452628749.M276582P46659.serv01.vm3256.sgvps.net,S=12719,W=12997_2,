Yesterday was our biggest day of calling ever. Now we need to keep going.

Rigoberto -

Yesterday, during our statewide day of action, a truly staggering number of 
volunteers called an unprecedented number of voters and we smashed our 
previous records.

We fell just short of calling a quarter of a million voters, but we had more 
volunteers calling at one time than ever before in the campaign, and the 
majority of those volunteers were right here in Texas. We made history and 
called more Texans from Beaumont to El Paso in a single day than any 
campaign before.

It was a historic effort, but here’s the truth: We have to get much, much 
bigger if we want to win on March 1. And with the latest polls showing that 
we may be on track for an upset win in Iowa, we can’t afford to rest now.

Here’s what I need you to do: Sign up to host a phone bank, then host 
another one every week between now and March 1. 
<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/m/24fb2bf0/43b7f9e2/44fa8ffc/620f66ee/2028412863/VEsE/> 
I know that’s a big ask, but yesterday showed that together we can do big 
things and that’s what it’s going to take to win.

<https://go.berniesanders.com/page/m/24fb2bf0/43b7f9e2/44fa8ffc/620f66ee/2028412863/VEsF/> 
’ll provide you with everything you need to host a successful event, even if 
you’ve never done it before.

Our campaign has grown at an astonishing rate. A few months ago, Bernie was 
a long-shot underdog. Now no one can dismiss us, and it’s clear we have a 
pathway to victory.

But whether we win depends entirely on how many conversations we have with 
voters – and that depends on you.
