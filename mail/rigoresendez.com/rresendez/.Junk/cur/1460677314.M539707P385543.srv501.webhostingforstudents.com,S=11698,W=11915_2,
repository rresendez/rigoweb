I need to share a story with you, Rigoberto. It will probably anger you, but 
hopefully it will also inspire you to take action in support of one of the 
most courageous people I’ve met during this campaign.

Lucy Flores was the first Latina assemblywoman in Nevada and made national 
news when she became one of the first elected officials to testify about an 
abortion she had at the age of 16.

During her 2014 campaign one D.C. pro-choice group, EMILY’s List, endorsed 
her and added that she was an "inspiring community leader." They even kicked 
off a program to elect more Latinas to Congress in 2016.

But then Lucy Flores endorsed our political revolution before the Nevada 
caucus, and everything changed. EMILY’s List decided to endorse a different 
person in Lucy’s House race this time around. So I want to support Lucy like 
she’s supported us, because we stand together. And I am asking you to join 
me:
