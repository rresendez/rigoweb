The Clinton campaign thinks this campaign is over, Rigoberto.

They are wrong.

Maybe it's over for the insiders and the party establishment, but the voters 
in Indiana had a different idea. The campaign wasn't over for them. It isn't 
over for the voters in West Virginia. It isn't over for Democrats in Oregon, 
New Jersey and Kentucky. It isn't over for voters in California and all the 
other states with contests still to come.

I understand we have an uphill climb to victory, but we have been fighting 
uphill from the first day of this campaign. I am in this campaign until the 
last vote is cast, and that's why I have to ask:

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/indiana-win?refcode=em160504> 
We have received over 50,000 contributions in the last 12 hours. If you can 
add one more $15 donation to our campaign, it will ensure we have the 
resources to fight and win through the remaining states and all the way to 
the Democratic Convention.

Last night Donald Trump became the presumptive nominee of the Republican 
Party. Poll after poll shows we are the best campaign to take him on, and by 
a wide margin. There is nothing I would like more than to take on and defeat 
Donald Trump, someone who can never become president of this country. And 
that is why we must continue to fight for the values we share, and to win 
this primary.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders
