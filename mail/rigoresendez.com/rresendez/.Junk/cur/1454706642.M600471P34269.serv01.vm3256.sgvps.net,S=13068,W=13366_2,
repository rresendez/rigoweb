Rigoberto -

Imagine this: The polls close on March 1 and the votes are tallied. Bernie 
comes up just shy of victory. How would you feel?

I’d ask myself what more I could have done to help Bernie win – and regret 
it if I could have done more. You and I are the campaign. If we don’t do the 
work, nobody will.

The number of phone calls we make by the end of the month will be the most 
important factor in whether we win or lose in Texas. Every calling shift 
matters. Bernie supporters in your community are getting together to make 
phone calls – will you join them?

This isn’t just about victory or defeat – the margin by which we lose or win 
matters, too, since Texas’ delegates are divided up proportionally. If we 
win by a larger margin or close the gap in certain districts, we get more 
delegates. So there’s truly more meaningful work we can do for Bernie 
between now and election day than we’ll have the time or resources to do.

There are few things more important than electing the next president of the 
United States, so we need to do the hard work that can put Bernie in the 
White House.

In it to win it,

Jacob Limon
Texas State Director
