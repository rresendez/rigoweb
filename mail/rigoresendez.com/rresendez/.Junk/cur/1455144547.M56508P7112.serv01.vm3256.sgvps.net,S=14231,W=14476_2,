Rigoberto -

I am going to share some information with you that will send shivers down 
the spines of the nation's financial elite and political establishment:

Since the polls closed in New Hampshire yesterday evening, we have received 
more than 150,000 contributions from people across the country for a grand 
total of $5.2 million... in just 18 hours.

So we've set an audacious goal, but one we can reach together if everyone 
chips in one more time:

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/what-we-do-next?refcode=em160210-e>Contribute $5 right now to help our campaign reach $6 million raised onlinesince the polls closed last night in New Hampshire. <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/what-we-do-next?refcode=em160210-e>Contribute<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/what-we-do-next?refcode=em160210-e>What we are doing on this campaign is telling the billionaire class and the1 percent of this country that they cannot have it all. That we will nolonger continue to accept a corrupt campaign finance system that isundermining our democracy. That the people of this country want real change.But as we've seen, the protectors of the status quo will not go down withouta fight. Two weeks ago, we learned that Wall Street contributed over $15million to one of Hillary Clinton's super PACs.There are 14 primaries and caucuses over the next three weeks, and we expectthem to ramp up their opposition to our campaign as a result of ourtremendous success. That's why it's so important we hit this goal: <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/what-we-do-next?refcode=em160210-e> Contribute $5 right now to help our campaign reach $6 million raisedonline since the polls closed last night in New Hampshire.When we started this campaign last April, we had no money, no organization,and were taking on the most powerful political organization in the UnitedStates.Look how far we've come. And if we continue to stand together, we are goingto win.In solidarity,Jeff WeaverCampaign ManagerBernie 2016Contribute<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/what-we-do-next?refcode=em160210-e>Paid for by Bernie 2016  <https://s.bsd.net/bernie16/main/page/-/website/billionaires.png>PO Box 905 - Burlington VT 05402 United States - (855) 4-BERNIEThis email was sent to rresendez@rigoresendez.com.
