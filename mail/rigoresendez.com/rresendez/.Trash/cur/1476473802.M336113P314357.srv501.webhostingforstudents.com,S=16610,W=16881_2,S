Rigoberto,

The disastrous decisions of the Supreme Court in the Citizens United case 
and related cases are undermining the very foundations of American democracy 
and allowing billionaires and their super PACs to buy politicians and 
elections.

In essence, the Citizens United ruling handed millionaires and 
billionaires — who have already rigged the economy — unlimited influence in 
American elections. It gave billionaires like the Koch Brothers and Sheldon 
Adelson the opportunity to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to elect 
candidates from the White House the state legislatures who will represent 
their interests. In essence, Citizens United is moving us toward an 
oligarchic form of society in which a handful of billionaires will control 
the economy and political life.

The Washington Post, in an excellent article, showed us how far the country 
is moving toward becoming an oligarchy. Incredibly, just TEN donors have 
poured more than $1.1 BILLION into super PACs in this election alone.

The lesson here is that the political system isn't broken, it is rigged and 
owned by the billionaire class. One of the best chances to un-rig the system 
is with ballot initiatives this November that will help get big money out of 
politics.

California and Washington both have ballot initiatives that will instruct 
their state's elected officials to do everything in their power to work to 
overturn Citizens United. And Howard County, Maryland, has the chance to 
enact a strong system of public financing to level the playing field for 
local elections.

If these ballot initiatives pass, they will send an unmistakable message 
that the American public wants to get big money out of politics. That is why 
they need your help today:

 <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/money-in-politics?refcode=em161014-full-full>Split a $15 contribution to the campaigns for I-735 in Washington, Prop 59in California, and Fair Elections Howard County and help these ballotinitiatives win. Make your contribution now.The need for real campaign finance reform is not a progressive issue. It isnot a conservative issue. It is an American issue.The job now is to get big money out of politics and to end votersuppression. The country has got to create a true democracy of one-person,one-vote, not billionaires buying elections.As Abraham Lincoln reminded us more than 150 years ago, there must be agovernment of the people, by the people and for the people. That starts withtaking the country's destiny out of the hands of the billionaires who wantto buy elections.Citizens United must be overturned to get big money out of politics. Morecities, counties and states need to move toward public financing ofelections that will level the playing field for people who want to run foroffice.I applaud Our Revolution’s work helping to get big money out of politics,and now I am asking for your help today for the ballot initiatives inCalifornia, Washington, and Maryland that, if passed, will move the countrytoward reclaiming American democracy from the billionaire class. <https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/money-in-politics?refcode=em161014-full-full> Please split a $15 contribution between the campaigns helpingpass three ballot initiatives to get big money out of politics.Together, the American people can show the political establishment that it'spossible to win elections powered by ordinary Americans, not millionaires,billionaires, and their super PACs.
