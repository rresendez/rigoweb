Subject: Test Reminders

This is a just-in-case reminder.  We are conducting two tests this week,
both with the $20 discount that I like to remind all of you about.

First test is in Kerrville on the 23rd at 2 pm, at Weir Hall on its second
floor, and the other test is at Wayland Baptist U on IH 35N in San Antonio
on Sat the 24th at 9 am.

Reservations to Gary Ramsey at 830-739-1730 for the Kerrville test, and to
me at 210-637-6161 for the Wayland Bapt U test.

Yes, I am uncomfortable sending out what might well be called nagging by
sending you so many repeated announcements, but I feel uncomfortable if I
don't remind you when the significant discount is not regularly offered.

Roy
