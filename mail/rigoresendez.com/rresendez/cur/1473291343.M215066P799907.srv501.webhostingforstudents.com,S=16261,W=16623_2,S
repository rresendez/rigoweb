Rigoberto -

Something shocking happened this weekend to the Lakota and Sioux activists =
in North Dakota who have been protesting a pipeline for fracked oil. The =
private security firm hired by the pipeline company attacked the activists =
with dogs and pepper spray.

This oil company is trying to build a pipeline for fracked oil all the way =
from North Dakota to Illinois. It would carry some of the dirtiest oil on =
the planet and present a tremendous threat to our planet's fight against =
climate change. It's called the Dakota Access pipeline, and it must be =
stopped.

Using dog and pepper spray against peaceful activists is a dangerous and =
unacceptable escalation by a company that is apparently desperate to build =
its $3.6 billion pipeline for fracked oil. We must stand with those =
fighting the Dakota Access pipeline and stop it from being built.

Add your name to say you oppose the construction of this fracked oil =
pipeline.

https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/stop-the-dakota-access-pipeline


Activists led by Native American tribal nations are fighting the pipeline =
with both grassroots activism and legal tools. Bernie Sanders even issued =
this call to action to support their work:

"Like the Keystone XL pipeline, which I opposed since day one, the Dakota =
Access fracked oil pipeline will transport some of the dirtiest fuel on =
the planet. Regardless of the court's decision, the Dakota Access pipeline =
must be stopped. As a nation, our job is to break our addiction to fossil =
fuels, not increase our dependence on oil. I join with the Standing Rock =
Sioux Tribe and the many tribal nations fighting this dangerous pipeline."

Because the pipeline would go through their land, the Standing Rock Sioux =
tribe and other nations have been leading prayer protests for months. =
Other activists in the way of the pipeline have fought the oil company =
too.

But it's incumbent on all of us to stand up to this pipeline. For the =
tribal nations who would have their lands endangered, for the farmers and =
residents who would have their water threatened, and for all of us who =
need to fight the effects of climate change.

When people stand together, we can defeat the greed of the biggest fossil =
fuel companies. That's what the activists from North Dakota to Illinois =
are proving, and they need us to stand with them.

Say you stand with activists who oppose the Dakota Access pipeline for =
fracked oil. Add your name now and help stop this pipeline.

https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/stop-the-dakota-access-pipeline

When we all stand up to big corporations who want to profit off of climate =
change, we can win. Thanks for taking action.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver
