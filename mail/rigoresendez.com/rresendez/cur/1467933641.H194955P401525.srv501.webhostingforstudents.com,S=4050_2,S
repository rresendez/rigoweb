Hi

The next Mensa test in San Antonio is that date, 9 am at Wayland Baptist Univ.  As always, I wish we could test at a later time of day, based on the idea that being in a test taking mode at 9 am on a Sat morn is a hard job, but that is the day and time we have available to us.

Please then take the test then, if you are in or near San Antonio.

If in or near Kerrville, please contact Gary Ramsey at 830-739-1730 to arrange for a mutually convenient time.  He does schedule tests, but often is open to a mutual convenience.

Good news if you are in or near Corpus-we will have a proctor there, but the bad news is that it will take a long time, maybe as long as six months or a year, but we will get back there.

Now for the details of the San Antonio test, and a sincere wish that you can take it on July 23.  Please call me if you can take it then. 

We do as usual ask for reservations, so that first, the proctor is there, and that if the number is big enough, that he gets more tests on hand to be ready for you.

What to bring: Photo ID, TDL is a good one, pay the $40 testing charge by check or money order payable to American Mensa, or by using one of four credit cards, Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover. You don't need pencils or paper, and calculator and smart phone use isn't permitted.

Directions to WBU, at 11550 IH-35 North. Zip Code if needed: 78233-5309 The directions are for when you are on IH-35N, between Loops 410 and 1604 

Outbound: Take the Weidner Rd exit and stay on the outbound access road until you get to Wayland Way. WBU is on the far right corner. If you get to O'Connor Rd, follow the route for the inbound IH 35 N test takers, except that you will take a right on O'Connor. 

Inbound: Take the O'Connor Rd exit. Take a left on O'Connor and go one block to Randolph. Right on Randolph one block to Wayland Way. Right on Wayland W to the building on your right facing both WW and the access rd. That is Wayland Bapt U. Front door faces the parking lot. Come in and ask the guard where we are. 

Please either call me at 210-637-6161 or email me with any questions you have, either on the test or on Mensa itself.

We do look forward to your both taking the test.

Roy

PS: You get an at least monthly email from me, and I wish I didn't pester you all as often, but our test day reservations are made a month at a time, so I have to wait until all is firm, and then send it to you.
