We did conduct the Mensa test this morning that we said we would, but without having anyone from Wayland at the door to let us in, or for that matter, for unlocking the door.

Our proctor Richard Merrill was finally able to get into the building after going completely around it several times, and in so doing, finding a janitor or some other kind soul to let him and the test taker from Laredo into the building.

I would bet that at least some of you who also made reservations were not as lucky as those two, and so were forced to go back home or work after making the great effort to be there and ready.

To all of you, we sincerely apologize.

We will schedule a test in August there at Wayland, probably on Aug 27, but good news for those of you in and around Corpus.  We have a tentative test there on Aug 13.  The details aren't firm, and sorry for that this close to the date, but the problem is due to a new site.

That we might have one at all is due to the efforts of our new Proctor In Training there, Sylvia Whitworth, who is making the arrangements while also preparing for certification.  Thanks much to her.

Questions and comments on our testing program are invited, suggestions ditto. Any of those, or other items about Mensa, please call me at 210-637-6161 or email me at the above address.

Again to any of you who tried to take the test at Wayland this morning, please accept our sincere apology.

Roy
