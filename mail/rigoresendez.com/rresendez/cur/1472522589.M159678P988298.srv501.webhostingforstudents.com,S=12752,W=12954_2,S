commitments for the duration of the program No If you answered "no" to the  
previous question, briefly describe your other commitments. i enrolled for

are you applying to the (boot) Bootcamp? I'm in the IT master programs and  
I believe I do have a talent for coding. I was received the invitation at  
my utrgv mail. Tell us about your professional/educational career to date.  
What are you up to now and how did you end up there? I have a 3.9 GPA in MS  
on IT . Have completed Harvard CS50 have taken several courses with Khan  
Academy and Team tree house . I'm currently begining a nano degree on  
Android Development in Udacity developed by Google Describe your background  
with computer programming. Please be as detailed as possible. Feel free to  
include links to any applications you've built, courses you've completed,  
etc... Most of my old code exists at my webpage which I developed  
www.rigoresendez.com some of my most recent work in Django/python is here  
http://rresendez.pythonanywhere.com/ <= register to access the full web  
experience Also my php application to send free sms still works at  
http://rigoresendez.com/sms.php. Currently I'm working on a e-comerce  
webpage for jewelry for a family memeber i hope to implement bticoin  
payment since i took some lessons on bitcoin services as 21.co . The  
ability to think in a structured way, both creatively and quantitatively,

musical instrument counts) I do play guitar, piano and bass . I did learn

However ,to be honest that was a long time ago. I am that kind of ADHD that  
when focus can achieve anything . I have a passion for understanding ,  
solving and creating .I love code , because you can build so much with so  
little. Is there anything else you'd like us to know? This is a link to my  
CV

the best version of myself by helping you. The "C" in CSS stands for?  
Cascading In a short paragraph explain the difference between backend and  
frontend. Back end deal with the processing that happens outside the client  
computer , most of times this code is to be hidden form the client for  
security reason. The front end is what happens on the client side including  
the user interface. How many times does the loop run? Three What's the  
final value of i? -1.5 To the best of your knowledge explain what the code  
does. Enter "I don't know" if unable to answer. In each iteration "i" is  
divided by 2 and after 2 is subtracted. This is done until "i" is less than  
0 .
