Hi

This might be of interest to you. It was suggested by the Mensa National Office that this be sent to you all.  I've not tried it, but their idea makes sense.

"Wondering how you can take a peek at some of the kinds of questions featured on a Mensa Admission test? You can do that right now with the only official Mensa Practice Test https://www.us.mensa.org/join/mht/ offered online for just $7.99. This is a limited-time offer, so act quickly."

No arm twisting, again "suggestion".

Roy
