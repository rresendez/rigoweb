Rigoberto,

It looks like you got Paul Ryan's attention. And he's not happy.

The Speaker of the House forwarded the email Bernie sent to you to his =
entire fundraising list. You can see what he said below.

Paul Ryan really doesn't like that you donated more than $1.8 million in =
two days to take back the House and Senate (which is an AMAZING feat, and =
something for which we are so grateful). He even put in a big, red button =
when he forwarded Bernie's email that says "HELP STOP SANDERS."

We've got their attention. Now let's show what we really can do.

Split a $15 contribution between Bernie's thirteen candidates for the =
House and Senate so we can take back Congress, make Bernie a committee =
chairman in a Democratic Senate, and enact our progressive agenda.


https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/paul-ryan-sad

The incredible contributions you've made in the last two days are =
completely changing the dynamics of these races for Congress. We are so =
grateful, because your support means campaigns can train more volunteers, =
talk to more voters, and turn out more people on Election Day.

Paul Ryan knows the tremendous impact you're having, and he's scared. =
Let's keep it going.

In solidarity,

Team Bernie

I spoke last week about what would happen if we lose our majority in =

showed me the message he sent to his supporters yesterday....

Read it and find out why it is so important to hold the House and Senate =
this November.

Bottom line: we must stop Bernie Sanders, Nancy Pelosi, and the =

donation today to stop this dangerous, progressive agenda.

Help Stop Sanders

Thank you.

Let's do this,

Sisters and Brothers,

I heard what Paul Ryan said about me: that if the Republicans lose the =
Senate, I will be the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.

That sounds like a very good idea to me. It means that we can establish =
priorities for working people, and not just the billionaire class.

What would be equally exciting is if the Democrats took back the House, =
and Congressman Ryan was no longer Speaker. That would mean the clearest =
possible path to enact our agenda - the most progressive agenda of any =
party in American history.

In the last day, you have responded tremendously to our call to support =
four leaders who will help shift the balance of the Senate. More than =
20,000 people have contributed more than $900,000 to ten candidates who =
are inspired by the political revolution.

During our campaign we pushed ourselves to reach goals that many thought =
impossible. That is why we set a very big, very audacious goal that we =
didn't know if we could reach, but that we thought it was very important =
to try. But you're about to smash that $1 million goal.

So, we're going to need a bigger goal.

Let's raise $2 million before tonight's final FEC deadline of the campaign =
for candidates for the House and Senate. Can you start with a $3 =
contribution between Paul Clements, Catherine Cortez-Masto, Deborah Ross, =
Zephyr Teachout, Morgan Carroll, Nanette Barragan, and Rick Nolan?


https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/paul-ryan-sad

Consider for a moment the power that exists in the U.S. Senate. Right now, =
the Republican majority is using their power to block any meaningful =
action on addressing income inequality or climate change. In addition, =
without a Democratic majority the Senate is refusing to confirm federal =
judges and, incredibly, has left open a critical seat on the Supreme =
Court.

With a Democratic majority, we can change all of that. What Paul Ryan is =
specifically afraid of is the power of the budget committee. That =
committee defines the spending priorities of the entire government. The =
work of that committee says how much revenue the government should have, =
and where its money should go.

I have some thoughts on how the government should allocate its spending. =
I'm sure you do, too.

The first step to being able to enact our progressive agenda is taking =
back the Senate. And if we take back the House... well, the sky is the =
limit for what we can achieve.

Help us reach for our new, audacious goal of raising $2 million for =
candidates for the House and Senate by midnight tonight. Add a $3 =
contribution now split between Paul Clements, Catherine Cortez-Masto, =
Deborah Ross, Zephyr Teachout, Morgan Carroll, Nanette Barragan, and Rick =
Nolan.
