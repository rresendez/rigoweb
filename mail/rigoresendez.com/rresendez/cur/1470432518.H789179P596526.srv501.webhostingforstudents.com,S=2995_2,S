Hi

We've had a nice response to the announcement of the test next weekend, specifically to the test at the Del Mar East Campus on Aug 13 at 10:15am.

Specifics about the location: Room 432A, fourth floor of the White Library, the tallest building on campus, and nicely, a white building.

We do still have tests and desks for others of you who might want to take the test then, but we do need for you to register with Sylvia Whitworth at jimcwhit@hotmail.com or by calling her at 361-853-9990.

Some info on the test:  It will be the Mensa Admission Test/Wonderlic combo, and will cost $40, payable when you come to take the test. You can use a check or money order payable to American Mensa, or by using a Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover card. 

You will need a photo ID; the TDL is the most used way, but a passport, military ID, or photo voter ID all do the job.  If the candidate is a minor, a birth certificate is often used.

The test can be taken by minors in the age range 14-17, but a parental consent form is needed. If this applies, please contact me, see below, and I can send you a copy of the form.

Main thing is that we want you in Mensa and if you live in or near Corpus, we encourage you to take the test on the 13th

Questions? Please call me at 210-637-6161 or email me at the From address.

Roy

Roy Huff, Testing Coordinator, South Texas Mensa
