Rigoberto,

Election Day is in two weeks, and we cannot allow the Koch brothers and =
other billionaires to buy elections throughout the country. Let's stand =
together and elect strong progressives who are fighting for real change - =
fighting to stand up for working families, the elderly, the children, the =
sick and the poor. Let's support candidates who are prepared to take on =
the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system away from coal =
and oil into energy efficiency and sustainable energy.

Our candidates are working hard and, in many cases, the polls show the =
races are very close. It is likely that the outcome will be decided by a =
few votes - one way or the other. Let's make sure that our candidates are =
on top.

I want to tell you about these candidates, their close races, and the =
billionaires trying to defeat them. But if you can contribute right now, =
please split a $15 contribution between the campaigns of Jane Kim, Sue =
Minter, David Zuckerman, Proposition 61 in California, and Eloise Reyes:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/billionaires-buying-elections?r=
efcode=3Dem161024-pt

In California, Jane Kim - one of the first candidates I endorsed, and who =
won her incredibly close primary because of your support - is facing an =
outrageous amount of outside spending in her race for state senate. =
Billionaire-funded groups have spent $500,000 attacking her in just the =
last three weeks, with more sure to come. Jane is a true progressive, and =
she can defeat the big money interests if we are prepared to stand behind =
her.

In my home state of Vermont, Sue Minter is the Democratic nominee for =
Governor. She will be a strong leader in making higher education tuition =
free for all, and in the struggle against climate change. But a new poll =
shows she is one point behind the Republican nominee, who is receiving =
strong support from billionaires around the country. In my view her =
running-mate David Zuckerman, a family farmer and food activist, will be =
the most progressive Lieutenant Governor in the country. He is an =
outstanding member of the state senate who has taken on powerful special =
interests throughout his career.

Proposition 61 in California would lower prescription drug prices and =
challenge the price gouging of Big Pharma. As you might imagine, drug =
companies don't like it very much. They are spending more than $100 =
million to defeat this initiative, and just added another $22 million last =
week. A victory in California against the greed of the pharmaceutical =
industry is a victory for all of us.

Big oil companies want to defeat Eloise Reyes in her race for state =
legislature in California. Chevron has donated millions of dollars to =
outside groups trying to defeat Reyes because they know she would hold =
them accountable in the fight against climate change.

With just 15 days until the election, we need your support to expand our =
political revolution. Great candidates are being overwhelmed with huge =
contributions from the Koch brothers and other billionaires. Let's fight =
back and help our candidates win.

Please split a $15 contribution between Jane Kim, Sue Minter, David =
Zuckerman, Proposition 61 in California, and Eloise Reyes:
