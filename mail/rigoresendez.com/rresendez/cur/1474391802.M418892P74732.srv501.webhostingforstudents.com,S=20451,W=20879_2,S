Rigoberto,

Change never happens from the top down, it always occurs from the bottom =
up. This is just as true for how we can win long-lasting progressive =
change in our cities and our states.

We want to help progressives who are fighting for change at the local =
level. So today we're endorsing 10 local candidates who represent the =
future of our political revolution.

Some of these candidates could help determine how congressional districts =
are drawn for the remainder of the next decade -- a key to progressives =
gaining power in the House of Representatives for the decade to come. =
Others can use their offices to create real change for voting rights, =
equal pay, and economic justice.

It's up to us to transform the future of our country, and that's why we =
are proud to ask:

Can we count on you to split a $15 contribution to this great slate of =
progressive local candidates and Our Revolution as a way of saying we are =
going to fight to transform our country from the bottom up?

m160920-pt

Sara Niccoli is a farmer and advocate for working people running for New =
York's state senate. She's running on a platform that will always put her =
community ahead of corporate interests. A victory for Sara would help turn =
the tide against the narrow majority in New York's senate held by =
conservatives and corporate-backed politicians.

Teresa Meyer is a registered nurse who would be a tremendous state =
representative in Iowa. She wants to increase the minimum wage, and she's =
seen in her career how difficult it can be for patients to navigate health =
insurance companies to get the care they need. She'll be on the side of =
working families in Iowa.

Brad Avakian has spent his career fighting for working people, and now =
he's running to be Oregon's next Secretary of State. As the state's labor =
commissioner, Brad fought wage theft and civil rights abuses. And if Brad =
wins, he plans to use his office to ensure Oregon corporations provide =
equal pay for equal work.

Adrian Fontes should be Maricopa County, Arizona's next County Recorder. =
You might remember huge lines, delays, and disenfranchisement during =
Arizona's presidential primary. Well, that was partially thanks to =
Adrian's opponent, because the county recorder is in charge of voting =
access and rights in Arizona's biggest county. Adrian is running to =
restore voting rights and to protect democracy.

Dan Quick is a proud union member running to be a state senator in =
Nebraska. Dan's fought against corporate privatization of public =
utilities, and he would be a strong advocate for working families in =
Nebraska's state senate.

Mari Cordes is a registered nurse running for Vermont's state house who =
knows we need universal health care. She wants to remove corporate greed =
from our health care system because she's seen how insurance companies get =
in the way of patient care. That's why Mari will fight for a =
publicly-funded health care system.

Gary Kroeger is running as a proud progressive to be a state =
representative in Iowa. He will fight to protect students, the =
environment, and working people, and will help advance the ideals of our =
political revolution.

Jane Kim is a civil rights attorney who's fought for affordable housing =
and fair wages and who is running for California's state senate. You've =
met her before: Bernie Sanders' endorsement, along with thousands of =
contributions from our political revolution, helped Jane pull off a =
shocking win in her primary in June. Now she needs our help in her general =
election to secure another huge victory.

Nicole Cannizzaro knows the value of public education, and that's why =
she's running to be a state senator in Nevada. She benefited from Nevada's =
state-funded educational opportunities that helped her go to college and =
become a lawyer. She'll fight to protect and expand those programs in =
Nevada's state senate.

Sabrina Shrader uses her experience growing up in poverty to help others, =
and now she's running for West Virginia's state house. After a difficult =
childhood, Sabrina shares her story with other families struggling in =
poverty and works to help them get back on their feet. She would be a =
tremendous advocate in West Virginia's legislature.

Can you split a $15 contribution to these candidates and Our Revolution as =
a way of saying we are going to fight to transform our country from top to =
bottom?

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/10-local-candidates?refcode=3De=
m160920-pt

We have the opportunity to help these folks win their local races. If =
they're successful, they'll help create lasting progressive policies, and =
some might even go on to be members of Congress, senators, and governors.

That is the political revolution, and that's why splitting your =
contribution between this great slate of local candidates and Our =
Revolution is so important.

In solidarity,

Shannon Jackson
Executive Director
Our Revolution
