We are very happy to resume testing in Corpus, starting at 10:15am on Saturday, Aug 13.

The test will be given on the Del Mar East Campus.  Specifically, it will be in Room 432A on the fourth floor of the White Library.  The Library is the tallest building on that campus, and is white.  PS in mid-stream: The water tower is taller.

The Library is close to the corner of Ayres and Baldwin, with the street address of 101 Baldwin, but it is farther down the street than the corner.

Reservations are needed, and are made by email or phone to Sylvia Whitworth at jimcwhit@hotmail.com or by calling 361-853-9990.  Sylvia asks that you help avoid a spam dump by including Mensa in your subject line.

Test payment of $40 can be made by check or money payable to American Mensa, or by use of a Visa, MasterCard, Am Express, or Discover card.

You will also need a photo ID, be 17 or older, or 14-16 years old with a signed parental permission form.  If you need that form, please email me, or call me at 210-637-6161.

Another picky requirement: You can't have previously taken the Mensa Admission or Wonderlic tests.

Questions on this, or others on Mensa, please call me at 210-637-6161 or email me at the From address.

Good luck, we want you in Mensa.

Roy
