Rigoberto,

There's so much at stake for our country in November. Our Revolution has =
endorsed candidates and ballot measures up and down the ballot in almost =
every state, and in many cases they are facing fierce competition from =
powerful establishment and corporate interests. Now is the time to stand =
together on these important fights!


We've endorsed candidates in Texas. While you may not be able to vote for =
all the priorities endorsed by Our Revolution, it's important for you to =
know that we're working to make Texas more progressive.


This starts with you committing to vote in the election. Early voting is =
already underway in Texas, and you can vote early until November 4. =
Otherwise you can vote on Election Day on Tuesday, November 8.

Are you in? Let us know you plan to vote.

COMMIT TO VOTE =C2=BB https://go.ourrevolution.com/page/s/commit-to-vote-e=
arly?source=3Dem161021-pt


Our Revolution endorsements in Texas:

Jared Cates for Nacogdoches County Commissioner
Inspired by his mother's battle with cancer, Jared has been passionately =
advocating for marijuana reform, other civil liberty issues including race =
and gender equality, marriage equality, and women's health. Jared is =
dedicated to revitalize the local economy and community through resilient =
economic development principles, a focus on local businesses, community =
involvement, and a determination to leave a better environment for future =
generations.

Julie Nitsch for Austin Community College Board of Trustees
Inspired by her volunteer work for the Bernie 2016 campaign, Julie wants =
to continue the political revolution by fighting to provide students and =
teachers with the quality education they deserve. Additionally, Julie =
wants to provide a health center and affordable childcare options to =
students, improve access to public transportation, and ensure educators =
have a living wage and healthcare benefits.


This is Our Revolution, and we will only bring about the change we need in =
our country if all of us are deeply involved. That's why today we're =
asking you to commit to vote in this election.

COMMIT TO VOTE =C2=BB https://go.ourrevolution.com/page/s/commit-to-vote-e=
arly?source=3Dem161021-pt

It's going to take a movement united if we're going to build the =
progressive, compassionate and equitable country we so believe in. We look =
forward to continuing this important work with you.

In solidarity,

The Team at Our Revolution
