The PythonAnywhere newsletter, July 2016
========================================

A very warm summer greeting from PythonAnywhere!  Here's the latest on what we're doing and what we've done.


The PythonAnywhere API (first steps)
-------------------------------------

For a while, people have been asking us for an API to control PythonAnywhere functions from scripts.  We've just made the very first steps in that direction... it's definitely not ready for prime-time yet, but if you're keen to take a look, get in touch, and we'll switch it on for you.  Currently the API allows you to do stuff to your web apps, namely:

* create a new web app
* reload a web app
* update webapp settings: virtualenv, static files.

The API may well change in the future, so don't build anything mission-critical based on it -- but if you want to be able to give feedback and shape version 1.0, then now's the time to try it out.


micro:bit
---------

The micro:bit is a tiny computer created by a project run by the BBC here in the UK, to help kids learn how to code rather than being passive consumers of media.  It can run on a battery and has Bluetooth, MicroUSB, and an embedded ARM processor.  Free ones are being sent to every child in year 7 (12 year-olds) in the UK, but you can also buy them.  They're a great tool for learning Internet-of-Things coding.

Due to the sterling efforts of [Nicholas Tollervey](http://ntoll.org/article/story-micropython-on-microbit) (UK Python guru, computing-in-education expert, and all-round nice guy) and Damien George (creator of MicroPython and also super-nice), one of the languages supported on the micro:bit is Python :-)   We're very proud to be the hosts of the Python portion of the official online IDE for the micro:bit.


The inside scoop from our forums
--------------------------------

* Are you a teacher, or do you want to embed consoles in your blog posts with code examples so that your readers can try them out?  [Harry recommends Gist consoles](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/forums/topic/5203/)
* Interested in hosting multiple domains with the same codebase?   You don't need multiple copies of your code.  [This forum thread explains how to set things up using Django](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/forums/topic/5279/).
* Some hints on how to do [automated offsite backups of your MySQL databases](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/forums/topic/119/#id_post_22721) on PythonAnywhere from R. Cooke.


New modules
-----------

Although [you can install Python packages on PythonAnywhere yourself](https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/InstallingNewModules), we like to make sure that we have plenty of [batteries included](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/batteries_included/).

There's some big news coming in this area soon, but for now we just have a few useful new modules to report.

We've added some Linux system packages so that you can access them from bash consoles:

* asciidoc: an ASCII format for writing stuff.  A bit like Markdown.
* octave: a free MatLab clone.
* tcsh: an extension of csh.

And some Python packages:

* django-object-tools v1.9 for Python 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5.
* mimerender v0.6.0 for Pythons 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5.
* tensorflow v0.8.0 for Python 2.7, and v0.9.0 for Python 3.4 and 3.4.
* praw v3.1.0 for Python 2.7, 3.3 and 3.4, and 3.5.0 for Python 3.5.
* Flask-Login v0.3.2 for Python 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5
* elaphe v0.6.0 for Python 2.7



New whitelisted sites
---------------------

Paying PythonAnywhere customers get unrestricted Internet access, but if you're a
free PythonAnywhere user, you may have hit problems when writing
code that tries to access sites elsewhere on the Internet. We have to restrict you
to sites on [a whitelist](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/whitelist/)
to stop hackers from creating dummy accounts to hide their identities when breaking
into other people's websites.

But we really do encourage you to suggest new sites that should be on the whitelist.
Our rule is, if it's got an official public API, which means that the site's
owners are encouraging automated access to their server, then we'll whitelist it.

Here are some sites we've added since our last newsletter:

* api.coinsecure.in: the API for an Indian bitcoin exchange.
* api.datamuse.com: designed to help people create and communicate more effectively.
* api.hitbtc.com: "the most advanced Bitcoin exchange", or at least that's what they say.
* api.predictious.com: a prediction marketplace.  Not betting, no siree.
* api.ipify.org: a simple API to get your pulic IP address.
* api.meh.com: a very silly daily deal site.
* api.mymemory.translated.net: translations by humans, for humans.
* api.pinnacle.com: online betting.  Kind of like a prediction marketplace, but more regulated.
* api.robinhood.com: free stock trading. (We think they mean commission-free, you still have to pay for the shares.  Boo.)
* api.sendgrid.com: send email.
* berlin.de: information from the Berlin government.
* btcvol.info: tracks the volatility of Bitcoin prices in US dollars.
* cbr.ru: the Russian Central Bank.
* wheniwork.com: scheduling hours for hourly workers.
* ecb.europa.eu: the European Central Bank.
* eklima.met.no: free access to weather- and climate data from the Norwegian Meteorological Institute.
* googledrive.com: we think you know what this is.
* ipinfo.io: another API for your IP address
* ops.epo.org: access the European Patent Office's raw data.
* swift.org: download and install Swift packages.  The programming language, not Taylor.
* twitrss.me: get your Twitter feed in your RSS reader, where it's meant to be.
* wservice.viabicing.cat: information on Barcelona's bike-sharing scheme.
* www.deviantart.com: much less terrifying than it sounds.
* www.virustotal.com: analyse suspicous files and URLs and compare to known malware.
* www.yr.no: more Norwegian weather.
