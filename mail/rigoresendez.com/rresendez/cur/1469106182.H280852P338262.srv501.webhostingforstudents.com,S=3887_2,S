Hi rresendez,

Your web site "rresendez.pythonanywhere.com" for account rresendez is
about to expire. We will stop serving the site in 7 days.

Click here:

https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/rresendez/webapps/#tab_id_rresendez_pythonanywhere_com

...to bump the expiry date by another three months, and your site will
stay online.  This won't cost anything, it's still a free service -- we're
just making sure we're not hosting sites that people no longer want to have.

If you don't do anything, the site will no longer be served up -- but you can
always reactivate it by clicking the link above.



All the best,

The PythonAnywhere team
