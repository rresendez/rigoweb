Beston writes:

When this twentieth century of ours became obsessed with a passion for mer=
e size=2C what was lost sight of was the ancient wisdom that the emotions=
 have their own standards of judgment and their own sense of scale. In the=
 emotional world a small thing can touch the heart and the imagination eve=
ry bit as much as something impressively gigantic; a fine phrase is as goo=
d as an epic=2C and a small brook in the quiet of a wood can have its say=
 with a voice more profound than the thunder of any cataract. Who would li=
ve happily in the country must be wisely prepared to take great pleasure i=
n little things.

Country living is a pageant of Nature and the year; it can no more stay fi=
xed than a movement in music=2C and as the seasons pass=2C they enrich lif=
e far more with little things than with great=2C with remembered moments r=
ather than the slower hours. A gold and scarlet leaf floating solitary on=
 the clear=2C black water of the morning rain barrel can catch the emotion=
 of a whole season=2C and chimney smoke blowing across the winter moon can=
 be a symbol of all that is mysterious in human life.

ad never met a sole person of that vocation in real life. Decades later=2C=
 after she broke the glass ceiling in astronomy by becoming the first woma=
n permitted to observe at the prestigious Palomar Observatory and went on=
 to discover dark matter=2C Rubin reflected: =E2=80=9CIt never occurred to=

 a children=E2=80=99s book about Maria Mitchell =E2=80=94 America=E2=80=99=

 her horizon of possibility and seeded the idea that she=2C a little girl=
 amid a culture impoverished of

ing three children of her own=2C all of whom grew up to earn doctorates in=

In the introduction=2C Ignotofsky captures just what women in science have=
 been up against=2C as recently as mere decades ago=2C even though science=
 itself is millennia old:

Nothing says trouble like a woman in pants. That was the attitude in the 1=
930s=2C anyway; when Barbara McClintock wore slacks at the University of M=
issouri=2C it was considered scandalous. Even worse=2C she was feisty=2C d=
irect=2C incredibly smart=2C and twice as sharp as most of her male collea=
gues. She did things her way to get the best results=2C even if it meant w=
orking late with her students=2C who were breaking curfew. If you think th=
ese seem like good qualities for scientist=2C then you are right. But back=
 then=2C these weren=E2=80=99t necessarily considered good qualities in a=
 woman. Her intelligence=2C her self-confidence=2C her willingness to brea=
k rules=2C and of course her pants were all considered shocking!

Barbara had already made her mark on the field of genetics with her ground=
breaking work at Cornell University=2C mapping chromosomes using corn. Thi=
s work is still important in scientific history. Yet while working at the=
 University of Missouri Barbara was seen as bold and unladylike. The facul=
ty excluded her from meetings and gave her little support with her researc=
h. When she found out they would fire her if she got married and there was=
 no possibility of promotion=2C she decided she had had enough.

Risking her entire career=2C she packed her bags. With no plan=2C except a=
n unwillingness to compromise her worth=2C Barbara went off to find her dr=
eam job. This decision would allow her to joyously research all day and ev=
entually make the discovery of jumping genes. This discovery would win her=
 a Nobel Prize and forever change how we view genetics.

Barbara McClintock=E2=80=99s story is not unique. As long as humanity has=
 asked questions about our world=2C men and women have looked to the stars=
=2C under rocks=2C and through microscopes to find the answers. Although b=
oth men and women have the same thirst for knowledge=2C women have not alw=
ays been given the same opportunities to explore the answers.

Here=2C I=E2=80=99m reminded of how Maria Mitchell =E2=80=94 the first per=
son to discover a telescopic comet (https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/10/=

Russell was a founding father of modern atheism (https://www.brainpickings=
=2Eorg/2015/02/03/bertrand-russell-immortality-good-life/?mc_cid=3D0412440b3=
3&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) =2C but he was also animated by a resolute commitmen=
t to nuance and an unflinching defiance of dogma=2C be it religious or sci=
entific. He writes:

Metaphysics=2C or the attempt to conceive the world as a whole by means of=
 thought=2C has been developed=2C from the first=2C by the union and confl=
ict of two very different human impulses=2C the one urging men towards mys=
ticism=2C the other urging them towards science. Some men have achieved gr=
eatness through one of these impulses alone=2C others through the other al=
one: in Hume=2C for example=2C the scientific impulse reigns quite uncheck=
ed=2C while in Blake a strong hostility to science co-exists with profound=
 mystic insight. But the greatest men who have been philosophers have felt=
 the need both of science and of mysticism: the attempt to harmonise the t=
wo was what made their life=2C and what always must=2C for all its arduous=
 uncertainty=2C make philosophy=2C to some minds=2C a greater thing than e=
ither science or religion.

Where science is a function of reason=2C mysticism for Russell is a functi=
on of intuition and therefore a form of =E2=80=9Cpoetic imagination=2C not=
 science=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94 it is =E2=80=9Clittle more than a certain inte=
nsity and depth of feeling in regard to what is believed about the univers=
e.=E2=80=9D And yet it offers a powerful complement to the scientific lens=
 on reality. With an eye to the ethics of Heraclitus=2C he writes:

The facts of science=2C as they appeared to [Heraclitus]=2C fed the flame=
 in his soul=2C and in its light he saw into the depths of the world by th=
e reflection of his own dancing swiftly penetrating fire. In such a nature=
 we see the true union of the mystic and the man of science =E2=80=94 the=
 highest eminence=2C as I think=2C that it is possible to achieve in the w=
orld of thought.

This union of the intuitive and the empirical=2C Russell argues=2C is our=
 most promising conduit to truth =E2=80=94 the former contains our moral i=
deals=2C while the latter must test them against the reality which they ar=
e to inhabit. In a sentiment that calls to mind W.H. Auden=E2=80=99s asser=
tion that =E2=80=9Ca poet must never make a statement simply because it so=
unds poetically exciting; he must also believe it to be true=2C=E2=80=9D (=

truth-enchantment/?mc_cid=3D0412440b33&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) Russell writes:

Ethical considerations can only legitimately appear when the truth has bee=
n ascertained: they can and should appear as determining our feeling towar=
ds the truth=2C and our manner of ordering our lives in view of the truth=
=2C but not as themselves dictating what the truth is to be.

[=E2=80=A6]

It is only in marriage with the world that our ideals can bear fruit: divo=
rced from it=2C they remain barren. But marriage with the world is not to=
 be achieved by an ideal which shrinks from fact=2C or demands in advance=
 that the world shall conform to its desires.

Russell considers the nature of mystical experience:

Mystical philosophy=2C in all ages and in all parts of the world=2C is cha=
racterised by the belief in a way of wisdom=2C sudden=2C penetrating=2C co=
ercive=2C which is contrasted with the slow and fallible study of outward=
 appearance by a science relying wholly upon the senses.

In a passage that reminds me of physicist and novelist Alan Lightman=E2=80=
=99s beautiful account of a transcendent experience (https://www.brainpick=
ings.org/2014/01/15/alan-lightman-accidental-universe-science-spirituality=
/?mc_cid=3D0412440b33&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) =2C Russell adds:

All who are capable of absorption in an inward passion must have experienc=
ed at times the strange feeling of unreality in common objects=2C the loss=
 of contact with daily things=2C in which the solidity of the outer world=
 is lost=2C and the soul seems=2C in utter loneliness=2C to bring forth=2C=
 out of its own depths=2C the mad dance of fantastic phantoms which have h=
itherto appeared as independently real and living.

[=E2=80=A6]

The first and most direct outcome of the moment of illumination is belief=
 in the possibility of a way of knowledge which may be called revelation o=
r insight or intuition=2C as contrasted with sense=2C reason=2C and analys=
is=2C which are regarded as blind guides leading to the morass of illusion=
=2E Closely connected with this belief is the conception of a Reality behind=
 the world of appearance and utterly different from it. This Reality is re=
garded with an admiration often amounting to worship; it is felt to be alw=
ays and everywhere close at hand=2C thinly veiled by the shows of sense=2C=
 ready=2C for the receptive mind=2C to shine in its glory even through the=
 apparent folly and wickedness of Man. The poet=2C the artist=2C and the l=
over are seekers after that glory: the haunting beauty that they pursue is=
 the faint reflection of its sun. But the mystic lives in the full light o=
f the vision: what others dimly seek he knows=2C with a knowledge beside w=
hich all other knowledge is ignorance.

Indeed=2C art is in a sense a mystical experience =E2=80=94 something Saul=
 Bellow captured beautifully in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech (https:/=
/www.brainpickings.org/2015/06/10/saul-bellow-nobel-prize-acceptance-speec=
h/?mc_cid=3D0412440b33&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) =2C in which he observed: =E2=
=80=9COnly art penetrates =E2=80=A6 the seeming realities of this world. T=
here is another reality=2C the genuine one=2C which we lose sight of. This=
 other reality is always sending us hints=2C which without art=2C we can=
=E2=80=99t receive.=E2=80=9D But what Russell is concerned with is how mys=
tical experience relates=2C and whether it should at all=2C to science.

In addition to this sense of revelation=2C he argues=2C three other criter=
ia define mystical philosophy =E2=80=94 a =E2=80=9Cbelief in unity=2C=E2=
=80=9D which negates all polarities and divisions; a =E2=80=9Cdenial of th=
e reality of Time=2C=E2=80=9D which stems from the negation of divisions=
=2C for =E2=80=9Cif all is one=2C the distinction of past and future must=
 be illusory=E2=80=9D; and a belief that =E2=80=9Call evil is mere appeara=
nce=2C an illusion produced by the divisions and oppositions of the analyt=
ic intellect.=E2=80=9D He outlines this quartet of consideratoins:

Four questions thus arise in considering the truth or falsehood of mystici=
sm=2C namely:

1. Are there two ways of knowing=2C which may be called respectively reaso=
n and intuition? And if so=2C is either to be preferred to the other?

2. Is all plurality and division illusory?

3. Is time unreal?

4. What kind of reality belongs to good and evil?

Returning to the crux of his inquiry =E2=80=94 the possible complementarit=
y (https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/05/02/complementarity-frank-wilczek-=
a-beautiful-question/?mc_cid=3D0412440b33&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) of science a=
nd mystical philosophy =E2=80=94 Russell argues that while mysticism may b=
e misguided as a test of truth=2C there is something vital science can lea=
rn from its spirit of inquiry:

While fully developed mysticism seems to me mistaken=2C I yet believe that=
=2C by sufficient restraint=2C there is an element of wisdom to be learned=
 from the mystical way of feeling=2C which does not seem to be attainable=
 in any other manner. If this is the truth=2C mysticism is to be commended=
 as an attitude towards life=2C not as a creed about the world=E2=80=A6 Ev=
en the cautious and patient investigation of truth by science=2C which see=
ms the very antithesis of the mystic=E2=80=99s swift certainty=2C may be f=
ostered and nourished by that very spirit of reverence in which mysticism=
 lives and moves.

ption/?mc_cid=3D0412440b33&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) =2C Russell writes:

What I do wish to maintain =E2=80=94 and it is here that the scientific at=
titude becomes imperative =E2=80=94 is that insight=2C untested and unsupp=
orted=2C is an insufficient guarantee of truth=2C in spite of the fact tha=
t much of the most important truth is first suggested by its means=E2=80=
=A6 But in fact the opposition of instinct and reason is mainly illusory.=
 Instinct=2C intuition=2C or insight is what first leads to the beliefs wh=
ich subsequent reason confirms or confutes; but the confirmation=2C where=
 it is possible=2C consists=2C in the last analysis=2C of agreement with o=
ther beliefs no less instinctive. Reason is a harmonising=2C controlling f=
orce rather than a creative one. Even in the most purely logical realm=2C=
 it is insight that first arrives at what is new.

He is responding in large part to his contemporary and fellow Nobel laurea=
te Henri Bergson=E2=80=99s polarization of instinct and the intellect (htt=
ps://www.brainpickings.org/2012/08/07/henri-bergson-on-intuition-vs-intell=
ect/?mc_cid=3D0412440b33&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) . Russell argues that in the=
 most lucid and fertile form of thought=2C the two are not in opposition b=
ut in harmony:

Instinct=2C like all human faculties=2C is liable to error. Those in whom=
 reason is weak are often unwilling to admit this as regards themselves=2C=
 though all admit it in regard to others. Where instinct is least liable t=
o error is in practical matters as to which right judgment is a help to su=
rvival: friendship and hostility in others=2C for instance=2C are often fe=
lt with extraordinary discrimination through very careful disguises. But e=
ven in such matters a wrong impression may be given by reserve or flattery=
; and in matters less directly practical=2C such as philosophy deals with=
=2C very strong instinctive beliefs are sometimes wholly mistaken=2C as we=
 may come to know through their perceived inconsistency with other equally=
 strong beliefs. It is such considerations that necessitate the harmonisin=
g mediation of reason=2C which tests our beliefs by their mutual compatibi=
lity=2C and examines=2C in doubtful cases=2C the possible sources of error=
 on the one side and on the other. In this there is
no opposition to instinct as a whole=2C but only to blind reliance upon so=
me one interesting aspect of instinct to the exclusion of other more commo=
nplace but not less trustworthy aspects. It is such one-sidedness=2C not i=
nstinct itself=2C that reason aims at correcting.

The key to that harmony=2C Russell asserts=2C lies in bridging the expansi=
ve confidence of intuition with the balanced restraint of reason so as to=
 produce =E2=80=94 and isn=E2=80=99t that a most marvelous phrase? =E2=80=
=94 a =E2=80=9Clargeness of contemplation.=E2=80=9D

Its most compelling manifestation comes to life in Russell=E2=80=99s discu=
ssion of time and the question of whether or not it is real =E2=80=94 perh=
aps the greatest friction point between science and metaphysics=2C and one=
 that came to a head just four years later in Einstein and Bergson=E2=80=
=99s landmark debate (https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/12/09/the-physici=
st-and-the-philosopher-einstein-bergson-jimena-canales/?mc_cid=3D0412440b3=
3&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) =2C which shaped our modern understanding of time. W=
ith an eye to the mystics=E2=80=99 assertion that linear time is an illusi=
on=2C Russell writes:

It is difficult to disentangle the truth and the error in this view. The a=
rguments for the contention that time is unreal and that the world of sens=
e is illusory must=2C I think=2C be regarded as fallacious. Nevertheless t=
here is some sense =E2=80=94 easier to feel than to state =E2=80=94 in whi=
ch time is an unimportant and superficial characteristic of reality. Past=
 and future must be acknowledged to be as real as the present=2C and a cer=
tain emancipation from slavery to time is essential to philosophic thought=

A century before modern psychologists started probing the paradoxical psyc=
hology of time (https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/04/27/time-felt-marc-wi=
ttmann/?mc_cid=3D0412440b33&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) and today=E2=80=99s physic=
ists began exploring why we experience it as linear and can=E2=80=99t reme=
mber the future (https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/01/25/paul-davies-abou=
t-time/?mc_cid=3D0412440b33&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) =2C Russell speaks to thes=
e perplexities with astonishing intellectual precision:

The importance of time is rather practical than theoretical=2C rather in r=
elation to our desires than in relation to truth. A truer image of the wor=
ld=2C I think=2C is obtained by picturing things as entering into the stre=
am of time from an eternal world outside=2C than from a view which regards=
 time as the devouring tyrant of all that is. Both in thought and in feeli=
ng=2C even though time be real=2C to realise the unimportance of time is t=
he gate of wisdom.

That this is the case may be seen at once by asking ourselves why our feel=
ings towards the past are so different from our feelings towards the futur=
e. The reason for this difference is wholly practical: our wishes can affe=
ct the future but not the past=2C the future is to some extent subject to=
 our power=2C while the past is unalterably fixed. But every future will s=
ome day be past: if we see the past truly now=2C it must=2C when it was st=
ill future=2C have been just what we now see it to be=2C and what is now f=
uture must be just what we shall see it to be when it has become past. The=
 felt difference of quality between past and future=2C therefore=2C is not=
 an intrinsic difference=2C but only a difference in relation to us: to im=
partial contemplation=2C it ceases to exist. And impartiality of contempla=
tion is=2C in the intellectual sphere=2C that very same virtue of disinter=
estedness which=2C in the sphere of action=2C appears as justice and unsel=
fishness. Whoever wishes to see the world truly=2C to
rise in thought above the tyranny of practical desires=2C must learn to ov=
ercome the difference of attitude towards past and future=2C and to survey=
 the whole stream of time in one comprehensive vision.

[=E2=80=A6]

The beliefs of to-day may count as true to-day=2C if they carry us along t=

 beliefs to meet the new situation. All our thinking consists of convenien=
t fictions=2C imaginary congealings of the stream: reality flows on in spi=

In the winter of 1950=2C this tension between the forces of traditionalist=
 dogma and creative bravery crescendoed when the Academy of American Poets=
 (http://poets.org?mc_cid=3D0412440b33&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) awarded 56-year=
-old Cummings the annual $5=2C000 fellowship=2C conferring upon him both r=
enown and a small fortune equaling about $50=2C000 in today=E2=80=99s mone=
y =E2=80=94 a non-negligible sum for any artist=2C but especially for one=
 devoted to poetry=2C arguably the least lucrative of the arts=2C which ar=
tists enter (as the Talking Heads might say) =E2=80=9Cnever for money=2C a=
lways for love.=E2=80=9D

But among the tragic traits of our individualistic and competitive culture=
 is the impulse to tear down those who rise above the rest by attaining ac=
claim for their work=2C especially when there is financial gain. This is p=
recisely what befell Cummings=2C as evidenced by a series of letters I dis=
covered in the archives of the Academy of American Poets =E2=80=94 the ast=
onishing and astonishingly underutilized trove of cultural history that al=
so gave us the acutely timely story (https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/07=

 she was only in her twenties =E2=80=94 received two specimens of what can=
 best be described as hate mail. Hiding behind the pompous language of the=
 letter writers is an overeducated version of today=E2=80=99s average inte=

Both letters were published in the Winter issue of The Lyric =E2=80=94 the=

Dear Mrs. Bullock=2C

I address this bit of comment to you because you are the titular head of t=
he =E2=80=9CA.A.P.=E2=80=9D I am aware that you=2C personaly [sic]=2C do=
 not confer these Prizes=2C possibly do not always concur=2C but I must pr=
esent my protest to the official chief of the bund.

Recently the Academy awarded=2C or sponsored=2C a $5000 poetry prize to ee=
 cummings. This is the third time in the past five years that an important=
 prize for poetry has been given to a non-poet.

1st; =E2=80=94 The notorious Bellingen award for the pathetic mutterings o=
f the paranoid Ezra Pound=2C then THE PUBLISHER=E2=80=99S NAT=E2=80=99L BO=
OK AWARD for the amorphous imagery of Carlos Williams=2C and now the=2C [=
sic] =E2=80=9CA.A.P.=E2=80=9D prize for the disembodied metaphors of Cummi=
ngs; I had hoped to miss this last=2C and I am certain I shall not long su=
rvive the next=2C which will probably immortalize Jose Garcia Villas=2C si=
nce it is becoming increasingly apparent that the maverick element has an=
 organized system for winning these prizes.

The story of these awards is a complete breviary of the decline of schisma=
tics=2C down through skepticism to utter prosodical nihilism.

e e c. is not a poet. I quote

=E2=80=9CAnd there=E2=80=99s a hundred million others=2C
like all of you successfully if
delicately gelded (or spaded)
gentlemen and (ladies) =E2=80=94 pretty
littleliverpill=E2=80=9D

The man who could do this even once is not a poet. He was born outside the=
 pale: He is congenitaly [sic] incapable of any excursion into poetry.

I am told that he also paints a little. I am glad to hear this: if any of=
 the seven lively arts must suffer the intrusion of Cummings=2C let it be=
 painting: I have never been deeply concerned about the destiny of paintin=
g.

I am an old man; I take to heart what bits of hope I find=2C and these pub=
lic coronations lose half their significance when I remember that while th=
e Pyes and Cibbers were being officially ordained to the Laureateship=2C t=
he real poets of England were lovingly=2C though obscurely=2C building the=
 great temple of English poetry=2C and there are other consolations=2C not=
 the least of which is right in your own bailiwick=2C I mean the enthusias=
tic response to the =E2=80=9CLYRIC=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9CTHE LYRIC FOUNDAT=
ION=E2=80=9D made possible by the devoted philanthropy of Virginia Kent Cu=
mmins=2C your 5th. ave. Neighbor.

So it seems to me our American poetry may be on the mend=2C and indeed=2C=
 now that the stench of the maggoty putresence [sic] of James Joyce has a=
bout blown out of the world=2C I can sometimes think that the whole body o=
f English literature is looking up a bit.

Please give my regards to the six dissenting members of the panel that jud=
ged the Cummings book;

God bless you merry gentlemen=2C
May nothing you dismay.

Dear Mrs. Bulloch [sic]:

 and who are doing their best to undermine the basis of literature at the=

By this I refer=2C of course=2C to your award of a $5000 prize for poetry=

It is needless to defile this unoffending sheet of good white paper by rep=

=9Cseventy-one poems=2C=E2=80=9D and typical of much of his work =E2=80=94=
 and not even the most shameless of it.

Such work is not poetry by any conceivable standard. Such work is inchoate=
=2C perverse=2C vicious when it is not merely meaningless. Such work repre=
sents the sad effluvia of an addled mind. And I do not hesitate to state u=
nqualifiedly that any mind that in all sincerity accepts such work as poet=
ry is also addled. And the mind that accepts such work as poetry=2C but do=
es not do so in all sincerity=2C is worse addled; it is corrupt.

I state this=2C Mrs. Bulloch [sic]=2C not on a burst of passion=2C but as=
 the considered result of many years of experience=2C in which I have seen=
 the frauds and the perverters of values rising more and more to the foreg=
round and gradually usurping the place of those who are honestly working f=
or poetry. If I have spoken severely=2C it is because I believe that sever=
e speaking is the one thing left to bring back some semblance of fair play=
 and fair thought to persons and organizations supposedly charged with hel=
ping poetry. Your Academy of Poetry=2C if I may dare to say so=2C represen=
ts a magnificent opportunity. And what are the sponsors of that opportunit=
y doing with it. They are doing far=2C far worse than to throw away your t=
housands of dollars. They are using thousands of dollars to light the fagg=
ots whereby to burn poetry at the stake.

It may be late in the day; but I assure you that=2C though the smoke even=
 now is making an unholy stench=2C I shall spare no effort to raise an out=
cry against this sacrilege. And I believe I know others who will do likewi=
se.

Yours in sorrow=2C

Alex Jackinson=E2=80=99s letter

Jackinson writes:

Dear Stanton A. Coblentz and Doctor Earl Byrd;

With the Winter issue of The Lyric=2C I received copies of letters sent by=
 you to Mrs. Hugh Bullock=2C raking her over the coals for the Academy of=
 American Poets award to e e cummings. I was not happy about the award=2C=
 either. Personally=2C I would have bestowed the laurel upon Joseph Joel K=
eith=2C or some other up-and-coming poet. In my opinion awards are infinit=
ely more important at the start of a career=2C not some twenty years after=
 recognition has been won. But both your communication went beyond merely=
 presenting dissenting opinions; they were calculated attacks on modern po=
etry as such=2C and that is quite a different matter.

Mr. Coblentz. As a reader of Wings=2C I am familiar with your oft-repeated=
 stand. You are an uncompromising traditionalist who believes passionately=
 in rhymed=2C orderly=2C classical verse. You invoke the Gods to bring bac=
k =E2=80=9CShelly and Blake and Milton=2C Poe and Keats=E2=80=9D. Well=2C=
 who could object? But who knows in what vein the Old Masters would interp=
ret our unique=2C glitteringly appealing and repellent guys-and-dolls age?

Poetry =E2=80=94 living=2C not museum-piece poetry=2C must reflect the per=
iod in which it is written. War and chaos have plagued the world for quite=
 a long time=2C but each epoch creates its own special pulse-beat for the=
 artists to interpret. cummings did not create the past thirty years =E2=
=80=94 that frighteningly raucous=2C speakeasy-nightclub=2C kiss me daddy=
 eight to the bar=2C jazz-blues era. If our Freud-fraud=2C skyscraper-bill=
board-ad period is to reflect itself in poetry (and why shouldn=E2=80=99t=
 it be?) the jangled idioms of cummings and [Kenneth] Fearing are better=
 suited for it than the more sedate=2C traditional forms.

Doctor Byrd. You go on to say: =E2=80=9CI am told that he (cummings) also=
 paints a little. I am glad to hear this; if any of the seven lively arts=
 must suffer the intrusion of cummings=2C let it be painting: I have never=
 been deeply concerned with the destiny of painting.=E2=80=9D There is a c=
loser link between the arts than you might care to admit=2C Doctor. Painti=
ng (like poetry) was stagnating in shallow and murky pools when the Impres=
sionists burst upon the scene with vivid=2C un-chained hues. How the entre=
nched N.A.=E2=80=99s railed =E2=80=94 but to no avail. Is painting the poo=
rer for it that the museums have been forced to add a colorful Modernist w=
ing?

Mr. Coblentz. In last autumn=E2=80=99s issue of your fine magazine=2C you=
 ran a piece in which you bemoaned that the tidal wave (of modern poetry)=
 was not stopped when the break in the dike first appeared. How pathetical=
ly naive! =E2=80=A6 and reactionary! Stopped by whom? Think back. What was=
 the state of poetry =E2=80=94 native=2C not library poetry=2C when the Im=
agists=2C in necessary rebellion=2C poured over the wall? Glory to Harriet=
 Monroe for giving the insurgents a voice which is still heard. Oh=2C thos=
e refreshing sound-colors of Sandburg=2C Frost=2C Lindsay =E2=80=94 and=2C=
 of course=2C Eliot=2C Pound=2C Williams=2C Wallace=2C Stevens=2C Millay=
=2C William Rose Benet=2C Conrad Aiken=2C Allen Tate=2C Genevieve Taggard.=
 The list is endless.

To be sure=2C much of the =E2=80=9Cnew poetry=E2=80=9D was brash and unint=
elligible. That part will not endure. But most of it was original=2C intra=
nsigent=2C vital=2C inevitable and cannot be excluded from any comprehensi=
ve anthology of American verse. It is=2C in fact=2C about the only poetry=
 worth speaking of.

Today the poetic academicians claim many of the old avant guardists for th=
eir own =E2=80=94 a very familiar process=2C it would seem. If you=2C Doct=
or Byrd and Mr. Coblentz=2C and the Lyric Foundation=2C live long enough (=
and if cummings goes the way of all flesh)=2C you might wind up exchanging=
 bouquets. Meanwhile it might be pointed out that a bad case can be made o=
ut against any poet=2C Shelley and Keats included=2C by quoting isolated e=
xamples of their work. This=2C too=2C is cummings. Not the real cummings=
=2C but closer than the passages his detractors pick.

this is the garden; colors come and go=2C
frail azures fluttering from night=E2=80=99s outer wing=2C
strong silent greens serenely lingering=2C
absolute lights like baths of golden snow.
This is the garden: pursed lips do blow
upon cool flutes within wide glooms=2C and sing
(of harps celestial to the quivering string)
invisible faces hauntingly and slow.

This is the garden. Time will surely reap=2C
and on Death=E2=80=99s blade lie many a flower curled=2C
in the other lands where other songs be sung;
yet stand They here enraptured=2C as among
the slow deep trees perpetual of sleep
some silver-fingered fountain steals the world.

Doctor Byrd. Of the Bollingen Award winner you say=2C =E2=80=9Cthe patheti=
c muttering of the paranoid Ezra Pound.=E2=80=9D I agree. But is that all=
 there is to say about Pound? I would have shot the bastard as a war-time=
 traitor=2C and then posthumously awarded him a prize =E2=80=94 not for hi=
s murky Pisan Cantos=2C but for his brilliant early work=2C say what Pound=
 wrote between 1915 and =E2=80=9940.

No major poet is always easy to understand=2C and that applies from John D=
onne to Peter Viereck. But to wind up with cummins [sic]. Some of his mos=
t ardent champions (of whom I am not one) wish he had long ago dropped his=
 syntax distortions=2C his typographical idiosyncrasies=2C which mars more=
 than enhances his work; nevertheless there can be no easy dismissal of cu=
mmings as an authentic native singer=2C though this writer wishes he wrote=
 more in the tradition of the quoted sonnet than the nose-thumbing vein he=
 seems to prefer.

My own inclinations (as a reader of poetry) runs [sic] to that which is u=
nderstandable=2C lyrically expressed. So I prefer Keith to cummings. So I=
 subscribe to Wings and The Lyric. But Poetry and magazines of its kind al=
so have something to contribute. The times are very much with us=2C and th=
e culture of our day=2C such as it is=2C is too complex=2C too hydra-heade=
d for any one school of thought to dominate. That is the mortal danger=2C=
 the target at which we should vent our spleen=2C not at Mrs. Bullock =E2=
=80=A6 or eec.

Respectfully yours=2C

Alex Jackinson

Jackinson was so worked up about the exchange that he adapted his letter i=
nto a defense of Cummings published in the Congress Weekly later that year=
=2C in which he wrote:

Cummmings composes poems which scorch dollar-sign patriots=E2=80=A6 He bla=
sts bureaucracy in its hydra-headed forms. But throughout his work=2C Cumm=
ings=E2=80=99 sympathies are also discernible. One feels instinctively tha=
t he is passionately against youth being blackjacked by poverty=2C against=
 slums marring the April lilac smell. Cummings is wholeheartedly for more=
 freedom=2C joy=2C laughter.

But the best response came from Marie Bullock herself=2C forty at the time=
 and already the most influential and devoted champion of poetry in Americ=
a and quite possibly the world. She seems to have been so riled by Coblent=
z=E2=80=99s gall that she interrupted her holidays to personally respond t=
o him on December 27. Her letter is a masterwork of composure and calm con=
viction in the face of cynicism=2C envious embitterment=2C and misplaced i=
ndignation. It stands as a dignified vindication of art=E2=80=99s duty to=
 continually challenge tradition=2C reminiscent of William Blake=E2=80=99s=
 immortal defense of creative freedom (https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/=

Bullock writes:

Dear Mr. Coblentz:

Thank you for your letter of December 14th.

Mr. E. E. Cummings was elected 1950 Fellow of the Academy of American Poet=
s by a majority vote of our Board of Chancellors. Their selection of Mr. C=
ummings was based on achievement and need.

Personally=2C it seems to me that there are practically no poets living or=
 dead the scrutiny of whose work would not produce a number of poems objec=
tionable to some of their readers=2C at least.

We may not like novelty in its barest form=2C but it is sometimes necessar=
y for progress. Life would be dull indeed without experimenters and courag=
eous breakers-with-tradition.

That you truly share these feelings I am persuaded; particularly after rea=
ding your quatrain: =E2=80=9CIndividualist=E2=80=9D in the winter 1950=E2=
=80=931951 issue of the Poetry Chap Book.

In rewarding Edwin Markham=2C Edgar Lee Masters=2C Ridgely Torrence and Pe=
rcy MacKaye with $5=2C000 Fellowships=2C I feel that the Board of Chancell=
ors truly fulfilled the purpose of the Academy of American Poets in taking=
 the place of lacking federal and government aid for these worthy poets.

The latest award has proven that they are awake to the more modern trends=
=2C and that in honoring a younger man [ed: Cummings was 56] who is a tra=
ditionalist at the core and who is still actively creative=2C they look to=
 the future.

We believe the Academy of American Poets will steadily stand as the growin=
g hope of American poets who=2C wisely casting aside their petty jealousie=
s=2C will find in its rewards the recognition and appreciation which a cou=
ntry as large and great as ours knows how to bestow=2C on talent in all it=
s varieties.

Very sincerely yours=2C

 feelings towards the past are so different from our feelings towards the=
 future. The reason for this difference is wholly practical: our wishes ca=

as still future=2C have been just what we now see it to be=2C and what is=
 now future must be just what we shall see it to be when it has become pas=
t. The felt difference of quality between past and future=2C therefore=2C=
 is not an intrinsic difference=2C but only a difference in relation to us=
: to impartial contemplation=2C it ceases to exist. And impartiality of co=
ntemplation is=2C in the intellectual sphere=2C that very same virtue of d=
isinterestedness which=2C in the sphere of action=2C appears as justice an=
