Hi

That is the date for our next Mensa test in San Antonio.  It is our usual 9 am Sat test at Wayland Baptist Univ on IH 35N between Weidner and OConnor.

The test series is the Mensa Admission Test one, consisting of the MAT and the Wonderlic, takes about two hours, and costs $40, check or money order payable to American Mensa or by using Visa, Master Card, Discover, or American Express.

Test takers need to be 18 or older, have a photo ID, and have not taken the test series b efore.  Age 14-17 ok too, but need a parental permission form I'll send you on request.

We do need reservations, so please call me for that at 210-637-6161 or email me at the above address.  Questions too, really welcome, same tel or address.

We want you in Mensa, so please let us hear from you.

Roy
