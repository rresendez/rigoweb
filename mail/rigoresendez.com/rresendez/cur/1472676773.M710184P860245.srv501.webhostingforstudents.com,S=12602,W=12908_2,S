Rigoberto -

Last night was a tremendous night for our political revolution. Out of the =
five progressive primary campaigns we supported, three were victorious. =
But we did lose one, a big one, in Florida: Tim Canova against Debbie =
Wasserman Schultz.

As we move forward into the next chapter of our political revolution, we =
are going to win some elections, and we are going to lose some elections. =
But through it all, as Bernie said, our job is to transform the Democratic =
Party and this country. And it's our job to hold elected officials =
accountable when they work against the progressive values we all share.

During this race, Debbie Wasserman Schultz changed her position on a =
number of important issues, including fracking. And because of the =
challenge we gave her, you can expect a more fair and impartial Democratic =
National Committee in the next presidential primary.

Our involvement in all of the races we endorsed last night made us a =
better, stronger, and more progressive Democratic Party, and showed the =
continued power of our movement. These are the kind of challenges we're =
going to keep taking on, and it's why I have to ask:

Can I count on you to contribute $15 to Our Revolution as a way of saying =
you are still in the fight Bernie started to transform the Democratic =
Party, and to transform our country?

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our-revolution-victories?refcod=
e=3Dem160831-pt

The three candidates who won last night -- Dwight Bullard in Florida, and =
Mart=C3=ADn Quezada and Juan Mendez in Arizona -- join Zephyr Teachout, =
Pramila Jayapal, and other Our Revolution candidates who have already won =
their Democratic primaries.

And I know that if we continue to stand together and if we continue to =
organize in our communities, we are going to take our country back from =
the billionaire class.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver
President
Our Revolution
