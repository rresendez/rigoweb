Rigoberto,

Three candidates for Congress endorsed by Our Revolution are under attack =
by a billionaire-funded super PAC spending millions of dollars against =
them.

Zephyr Teachout in New York, Morgan Carroll in Colorado, and Tom Nelson in =
Wisconsin have all been targeted with millions of dollars in outside =
spending by a super PAC funded by billionaires like casino owner Sheldon =
Adelson and hedge fund manager Paul Singer.

These billionaires made their money off of working people, and now they're =
trying to buy seats in Congress. We can't let that happen.

During Bernie's campaign for president, we set big goals and went beyond =
the establishment's wildest expectations. That's why we're setting a huge =
goal of making 100,000 individual contributions by Friday's FEC =
fundraising deadline between the candidates endorsed by Our Revolution, =
starting with these three candidates under attack by a super PAC.

Split a $15 contribution between Zephyr Teachout, Morgan Carroll, and Tom =
Nelson to help them fight the billionaire-funded Super PACs before =
Friday's FEC fundraising deadline and put us towards our huge goal of =
100,000 contributions:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/super-pac-attacks?refcode=3Dem1=
60926-pt

It's very important we step up to help these three candidates who embody =
the ideals of our political revolution while they're under attack.

Morgan Carroll is very different from most legislators -- as a member of =
Colorado's state senate, she refuses to discuss legislation with =
lobbyists. Now she's running for Congress on a platform of overturning =
Citizens United, taking on corruption, and making our economy work for =
everyone.

Tom Nelson is a fierce advocate for working families running for Congress =
in Wisconsin. When a local mill shut down, Tom fought tax breaks for the =
company and worked to get the laid off workers new jobs. In Congress he'll =
fight for fair wages and oppose disastrous trade deals.

Zephyr Teachout is facing a former lobbyist in her race for Congress in =
New York. Zephyr's spent her life fighting political corruption, and her =
election is a perfect example of someone who'll take on special interests =
while facing opposition from lobbyists, billionaires, and super PACs.

Morgan, Tom, and Zephyr all need your help. They're fighting off millions =
of dollars supplied by billionaires to super PACs who want to see them =
lose. Our movement can fight back and prove we're stronger than =
billionaires and their super PACs.

Make a $15 contribution split between Morgan Carroll, Tom Nelson, and =
Zephyr Teachout to fight a billionaire class that wants to buy our =
democracy. Your support can help reach our goal of 100,000 contributions =
by Friday's FEC deadline:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/super-pac-attacks?refcode=3Dem1=
60926-pt

aWe have a big opportunity this week to both show the power of our =
political revolution and support candidates up and down the ballot by =
Friday's huge deadline. Through the week we'll tell you about more of our =
candidates who need help, and ask you to add contributions to reach this =
tremendous goal of 100,000 contributions to our candidates.

We can't wait to see what we can do together.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver
Our Revolution
