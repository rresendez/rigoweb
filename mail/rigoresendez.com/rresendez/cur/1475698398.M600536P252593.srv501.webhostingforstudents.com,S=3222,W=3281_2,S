Hi

The month of October is Mensa Testing Month, with Mensa Testing Day Oct 15.  The importance to those of you who are interested in taking the test is that the Oct testing fee is $20, half our usual charge.

In San Antonio, we are testing on Mensa Testing Day, the Oct 15 date in the subject above, at our usual Sat, 9 am, at Wayland Baptist Univ on the outbound access road of IH 35 N.

I hope that a number of you would like to take the test then since the $20 charge is a welcome tho temporary change.

Interested?  Questions about Mensa or the test?  Reservations?  Please email me at the above email address or call 210-637-6161.

Reservations again: Yes, we do need them to both ensure that we know at least one of you will be there so that the proctor, Richard Merrill this month, will be there.  It is also kind of convenient to help him know how many tests to bring.

Testing of prospective members 14-17 years old:  Yes, we like that, but will need a parental approval form that I will send you in response to your email or call.

Please do call me with any questions you might have, as I wrote above, and please know that we'd like for you to be a Mensa member.

Roy

PS: An apology in that I copied the text before sending and am not able to get rid of the blue highlighting.  Hope this comes through. and clearly.
