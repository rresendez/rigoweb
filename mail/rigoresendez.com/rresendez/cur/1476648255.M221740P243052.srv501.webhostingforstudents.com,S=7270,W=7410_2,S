Thanks, Rigo. I've watched some of Eli's videos.

I'll be applying to jobs during the cohort for next year. Teaching the
class is an opportunity to reinforce my understanding of things as I
explain concepts to others. Chances are I will find something outside of
the RGV, and do realize that to be the path I must follow to maximize my
opportunities.

I appreciate your input and support. Your motivation and drive impressed me
right away, and I hope your efforts are rewarded with opportunities that
meet your goals.

Best of luck on your exams, and see you on Tuesday!

Joel
