Hello,

Hope you're doing fantastic! I noticed that you just signed up at
HackerRank, and I wanted to personally thank you. I'm the
founder/CEO and my goal is to offer the best experience possible
to users.

HackerRank is here to create a community of developers who love
to solve programming challenges across computer science domains
and in over 30 programming languages. We have challenges spanning
Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and many
more! You'll solve a structured set of challenges that take you
through the basics to real-world in every domain in a way that is
fun but also helps you become the best developer you can be.
Solve at your own pace or compete in one of our contests ( https://www.hackerrank.com/contests?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=contests-campaign&utm_source=founder-email ).

To complement that, HackerRank partners with top tech companies
to offer exclusive jobs ( https://www.hackerrank.com/jobs?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=jobs-campaign&utm_source=founder-email ) to our developer community. Solve a company's code challenge
from our Jobs section and you're guaranteed a response from that
company within five business days.

Thanks again for signing up, and I'd love to hear any feedback
you have on HackerRank (good or bad). Have an awesome day and
happy coding!

Cheers,
Vivek
