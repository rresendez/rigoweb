Hi to all but especially to those of you in the Corpus area or who are interested in taking the test in Corpus.

We will be giving the Mensa Admission Test/Wonderlic series in Corpus on Nov 12 and hope you are available then,

Location and time not yet firm, but some time during mid-morning to mid-afternoon at Del Mar is a safe bet.

As soon as the info is firm, we will send it out and do apologize for not being able to give you the specifics as yet.

Questions are invited, on this or any other Mensa matter,  to the above email or by calling 210-637-6161.

Roy
