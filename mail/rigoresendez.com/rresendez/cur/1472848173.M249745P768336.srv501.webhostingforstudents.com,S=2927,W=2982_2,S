Hi

Some of you have said that you are interested in what is called the non-language test series, which consists of three tests, two of which are not timed.

Nice thing about this series is that it can be taken if you didn't qualify for Mensa using the regular MAT series, and since it is three parts, you get three chances to qualify.  Passing one is good for doing so.

"Non-language" in that the proctor reads the instructions to you and then turns you loose.  

Since that is not our usual test series, we don't do it very often, so what I want to do is to start a list of names and contact info for those who want it, and when we have a few of you who do want the test, we will set up a special test session and contact you who asked for it.

I'd like to have your name, email address, and telephone number so that we can let you know when the test is scheduled. You can send those to me by email or call me, your choice.

We do want you in Mensa, and want to give you the opportunity to do so this other way.

Roy
