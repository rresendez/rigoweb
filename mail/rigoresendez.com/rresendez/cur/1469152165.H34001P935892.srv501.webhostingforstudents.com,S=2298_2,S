Hi

We still have room for you. Logan, Ana, and Robbie have their reservations, but we want you too.

Yes, that horrible 9 am on Sat morning, but we will be there that early too.

Quick look:  Wayland Baptist Univ, 11550 IH 35N, which is on the outbound side of 35 between Weidner and O'Connor, $40, photo ID, reservations needed, never have taken the Mensa Admission Test/Wonderlic test series

We do need you to make a reservation to ensure sufficient tests are ready for you.  Call me at 210-637-6161-we'd normally accept email, but with only one full day left, please call, both for reservations and with questions.

Hope you can be there, we do want you in Mensa.

Roy
