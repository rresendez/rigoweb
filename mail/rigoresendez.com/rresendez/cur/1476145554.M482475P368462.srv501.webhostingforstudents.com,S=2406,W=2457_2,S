Hi

Actually this is a note of concern.  The test I'm writing about is this Sat, Oct 15, and it is one of the few opportunities to save test $, but we have no reservations.

Since it is possible that I have email problems, not too likely but possible, please call me at 210-637-6161 if you want to take the test this Sat at 9 am at Wayland Baptist U on IH 35N, whether you have made an email reservation or not.

We do want you in Mensa, and this half price deal is a nice way to open the door.

Thanks much.

Roy
