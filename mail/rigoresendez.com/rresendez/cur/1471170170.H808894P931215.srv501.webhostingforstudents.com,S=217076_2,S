6/03/31/dostoyevsky-reason-emotion/?mc_cid=3De946a042e8&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]=
) . On some elemental level=2C we intuit this to be true=2C and yet we som=
ehow let ourselves forget it as we grow older and more reliant on the inte=
llect as our supreme mode of knowing. We seem to remember it only in momen=
ts of suffering =E2=80=94 of emotional intensity so acute and uncontrollab=
le that it strips down our rationalizations and deposits us=2C naked and u=
nguarded=2C into the cradle of our own being. The wisdom of the heart that=
 we reap in that vulnerable state is of a wholly different order than the=
 intellectual insight we synthesize through deliberate rational thought.

This=2C perhaps=2C is what Rilke meant when he extolled sorrow as a suprem=
e tool of self-knowledge (https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/03/10/rilke-l=

 that he no longer loves her=2C he receives news of her death. He is sudde=

h =E2=80=94 a truth his intellect had rejected but his heart encoded far m=

In one particularly insightful passage=2C Proust channels through his prot=

 blinds us to the wisdom of the heart and how pain=2C above all=2C strips=
 down our intellectual defenses and puts us in raw=2C direct contact with=
 the emotional truth of our being:

I had believed that I was leaving nothing out of account=2C like a rigorou=
s analyst; I had believed that I knew the state of my own heart. But our i=
ntelligence=2C however lucid=2C cannot perceive the elements that compose=
 it and remain unsuspected so long as=2C from the volatile state in which=
 they generally exist=2C a phenomenon capable of isolating them has not su=
bjected them to the first stages of solidification. I had been mistaken in=
 thinking that I could see clearly into my own heart. But this knowledge=
=2C which the shrewdest perceptions of the mind would not have given me=2C=
 had now been brought to me=2C hard=2C glittering=2C strange=2C like a cry=

 confines of our perception.

Artist Agnes Margin memorably observed that =E2=80=9Cthe best things in li=
fe happen to you when you=E2=80=99re alone=2C=E2=80=9D (https://www.brainp=
ickings.org/2013/03/22/agnes-martin-1997-interview/?mc_cid=3De946a042e8&mc=
_eid=3D[UNIQID]) but Yong offers a biopoetic counterpoint in the fact tha=
t we are never truly alone. He writes:

Even when we are alone=2C we are never alone. We exist in symbiosis =E2=80=
=94 a wonderful term that refers to different organisms living together. S=
ome animals are colonised by microbes while they are still unfertilised eg=
gs; others pick up their first partners at the moment of birth. We then pr=
oceed through our lives in their presence. When we eat=2C so do they. When=
 we travel=2C they come along. When we die=2C they consume us. Every one o=
f us is a zoo in our own right =E2=80=94 a colony enclosed within a single=
 body. A multi-species collective. An entire world.

[=E2=80=A6]

All zoology is really ecology. We cannot fully understand the lives of ani=
mals without understanding our microbes and our symbioses with them. And w=
e cannot fully appreciate our own microbiome without appreciating how thos=
e of our fellow species enrich and influence their lives. We need to zoom=
 out to the entire animal kingdom=2C while zooming in to see the hidden ec=
osystems that exist in every creature. When we look at beetles and elephan=
ts=2C sea urchins and earthworms=2C parents and friends=2C we see individu=
als=2C working their way through life as a bunch of cells in a single body=
=2C driven by a single brain=2C and operating with a single genome. This i=
s a pleasant fiction. In fact=2C we are legion=2C each and every one of us=
=2E Always a =E2=80=9Cwe=E2=80=9D and never a =E2=80=9Cme.=E2=80=9D

There are ample reasons to admire and appreciate microbes=2C well beyond t=
he already impressive facts that they ruled =E2=80=9Cour=E2=80=9D Earth fo=
r the vast majority of its 4.54-billion-year history and that we ourselves=
 evolved from them. By pioneering photosynthesis=2C they became the first=
 organisms capable of making their own food. They dictate the planet=E2=80=
=99s carbon=2C nitrogen=2C sulphur=2C and phosphorus cycles. They can surv=
ive anywhere and populate just about corner of the Earth=2C from the hydro=
thermal vents at the bottom of the ocean to the loftiest clouds. They are=
 so diverse that the microbes on your left hand are different from those o=
n your right (https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/05/01/follow-your-gut-rob=
-knight/?mc_cid=3De946a042e8&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) .

But perhaps most impressively =E2=80=94 for we are=2C after all=2C the sol=
ipsistic species =E2=80=94 they influence innumerable aspects of our biolo=
gical and even psychological lives. Young offers a cross-section of this m=
icrobial dominion:

The microbiome is infinitely more versatile than any of our familiar body=
 parts. Your cells carry between 20=2C000 and 25=2C000 genes=2C but it is=
 estimated that the microbes inside you wield around 500 times more. This=
 genetic wealth=2C combined with their rapid evolution=2C makes them virtu=
osos of biochemistry=2C able to adapt to any possible challenge. They help=
 to digest our food=2C releasing otherwise inaccessible nutrients. They pr=
oduce vitamins and minerals that are missing from our diet. They break dow=
n toxins and hazardous chemicals. They protect us from disease by crowding=
 out more dangerous microbes or killing them directly with antimicrobial c=
hemicals. They produce substances that affect the way we smell. They are s=
uch an inevitable presence that we have outsourced surprising aspects of o=
ur lives to them. They guide the construction of our bodies=2C releasing m=
olecules and signals that steer the growth of our organs. They educate our=
 immune system=2C teaching it to tell friend
from foe. They affect the development of the nervous system=2C and perhaps=
 even influence our behaviour. They contribute to our lives in profound an=
d wide-ranging ways; no corner of our biology is untouched. If we ignore t=
hem=2C we are looking at our lives through a keyhole.

y Tales (https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/07/16/provensen-book-of-fairy-=

Kafka believed that we look at life through the narrow keyhole of our pers=
onal existence and in order to distinguish between appearance and reality=
=2C we =E2=80=9Cmust keep the keyhole clean.=E2=80=9D (https://www.brainpi=
ckings.org/2015/11/12/conversations-with-kafka-truth/?mc_cid=3De946a042e8&=
mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) Yong performs a masterful act of keyhole-cleaning in d=
emonstrating just how intimately entwined our personal existence is with t=
hat of the microbes that inhabit our bodies =E2=80=94 a relationship nowhe=
re more counterintuitive yet rife with promise than when it comes to our m=
ental health. It=E2=80=99s hardly instinctive to consider that biology=2C=
 much less microbiology=2C can influence the seething cauldron of mental a=
nd emotional experience we call psychology. And yet given the centrality o=
f microbes to our immune system microbes and the constant dialogue between=
 our immune system and our central nervous system in shaping our susceptib=
ility to stress and burnout
(https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/07/20/esther-sternberg-balance-within-=
stress-emotion/?mc_cid=3De946a042e8&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) =2C it pays to pro=
be how our microbiome might interact with our mental health.

Yong notes that research into this question is still in its nascency=2C so=
 most studies are small and inconclusive=2C but he points to several curio=
us and promising strands of research. One fMRI study by Kirsten Tillisch f=
ound that women who consumed a microbe-rich yoghurt displayed less activit=
y in brain areas implicated in processing emotions=2C compared to those wh=
o consumed a microbe-free yogurt. In a clinical trial by Stephen Collins f=
or patients with irritable bowel syndrome=2C a probiotic bacterium reduced=
 symptoms of depression. Psychiatrist Ted Dinan=2C who runs a clinic for p=
atients with depression=2C is wrapping up a clinical trial on =E2=80=9Cpsy=
chobiotics=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94 probiotics that might help people manage str=
ess and depression. Although Dinan himself is skeptical that such treatmen=
ts would be effective for those with debilitating clinical depression (htt=
ps://www.brainpickings.org/2016/02/09/depression-william-styron-darkness-v=
isible/?mc_cid=3De946a042e8&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) =2C he is hopeful that peo=
ple with milder mood disorders
might find some relief.

d-me/?mc_cid=3De946a042e8&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID])

But the most striking implication of even the very possibility that microb=
es might shape our moods is that they might also shape our choices and=2C=
 in consequence=2C our very destinies. Yong considers the overwhelming ran=
ge of imputations:

These studies are already forcing scientists to view different aspects of=
 human behaviour through a microbial lens. Drinking lots of alcohol makes=
 the gut leakier=2C allowing microbes to more readily influence the brain=
 =E2=80=94 could that help to explain why alcoholics often experience depr=
ession or anxiety? Our diet reshapes the microbes in our gut =E2=80=94 cou=
ld those changes ripple out to affect our minds? The gut microbiome become=

 what exactly is pushing that hand forward? From your perspective=2C choos=
ing the right item on a menu is the difference between a good meal and a b=

nt microbes fare better on certain diets. Some are peerless at digesting p=
lant fibres. Others thrive on fats. When you choose your
meals=2C you are also choosing which bacteria get fed=2C and which get an=
 advantage over their peers. But they don=E2=80=99t have to sit there and=

These questions flirt with the conundrum of free will (https://www.brainpi=

gely in the realm of the hypothetical=2C Yong points out that such depende=
ncies are far from uncommon in nature. He writes:

Nature is full of parasites that control the minds of their hosts. The rab=
ies virus infects the nervous system and makes its carriers violent and ag=
gressive; if they lash out at their peers=2C and inflict bites and scratch=
es=2C they pass the virus on to new hosts. The brain parasite Toxoplasma g=
ondii is another puppetmaster. It can only sexually reproduce in a cat; if=
 it gets into a rat=2C it suppresses the rodent=E2=80=99s natural fear of=
 cat odours and replaces it with something more like sexual attraction. Th=
e rodent scurries towards nearby cats=2C with fatal results=2C and T. gond=
ii gets to complete its life cycle.

The rabies virus and T. gondii are outright parasites=2C selfishly reprodu=
cing at the expense of their hosts=2C with detrimental and often fatal res=
ults. Our gut microbes are different. They are natural parts of our lives.=
 They help to construct our bodies =E2=80=94 our gut=2C our immune system=
=2C our nervous system. They benefit us. But we shouldn=E2=80=99t let that=
 lure us into a false sense of security. Symbiotic microbes are still thei=
r own entities=2C with their own interests to further and their own evolut=
ionary battles to wage. They can be our partners=2C but they are not our f=
riends. Even in the most harmonious of symbioses=2C there is always room f=

The interests of a writer and the interests of his* (https://www.brainpick=

[UNIQID]) readers are never the same and if=2C on occasion=2C they happen=
 to coincide=2C this is a lucky accident.

[=E2=80=A6]

To read is to translate=2C for no two persons=E2=80=99 experiences are the=
 same. A bad reader is like a bad translator: he interprets literally when=
 he ought to paraphrase and paraphrases when he ought to interpret literal=

Good taste is much more a matter of discrimination than of exclusion=2C an=
d when good taste feels compelled to exclude=2C it is with regret=2C not w=

[=E2=80=A6]

Between the ages of twenty and forty we are engaged in the process of disc=
overing who we are=2C which involves learning the difference between accid=
ental limitations which it is our study to outgrow and the necessary limit=
ations of our nature beyond which we cannot trespass with impunity. Few of=
 us can learn this without making mistakes=2C without trying to become a l=
ittle more of a universal man than we are permitted to be. It is during th=

 by some ideology When someone between twenty and forty says=2C apropos of=

6a042e8&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) by Robert Graves

The challenges of being a reader in many ways parallel those of being a wr=
iter=2C particularly when it comes to these tyrannical shoulds =E2=80=94 n=
owhere more so than in the perennially asked=2C perennially answered with=
 ire question of why a writer writes and for whom. Auden offers the most b=
eautiful answer I have yet encountered=2C at once utterly grounding and ut=
terly elevating:

A writer =E2=80=A6 is always being asked by people who should know better:=
 =E2=80=9CWhom do you write for?=E2=80=9D The question is=2C of course=2C=
 a silly one=2C but I can give it a silly answer. Occasionally I come acro=
ss a book which I feel has been written especially for me and for me only.=
 Like a jealous lover=2C I don=E2=80=99t want anybody else to hear of it.=
 To have a million such readers=2C unaware of each other=E2=80=99s existen=
ce=2C to be read with passion and never talked about=2C is the daydream=2C=
 surely=2C of every author.

In another essay from the volume=2C he revisits the same subject from a di=
fferent angle. Considering the extrinsic misconceptions and intrinsic self=
-delusions about why writers write =E2=80=94 a question that has garnered=
 some memorable answers from Pablo Neruda (https://www.brainpickings.org/2=
014/10/30/pablo-neruda-childhood-and-poetry/?mc_cid=3De946a042e8&mc_eid=3D=

er Wallace (https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/11/06/the-nature-of-fun-dav=
id-foster-wallace/?mc_cid=3De946a042e8&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) =2C Italo Calvi=

cid=3De946a042e8&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) =2C and William Faulkner (https://www=
=2Ebrainpickings.org/2014/09/25/william-faulkner-university-of-virginia-reco=
rding/?mc_cid=3De946a042e8&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) =E2=80=94 Auden offers:

Just as a good man forgets his deed the moment he has done it=2C a genuine=
 writer forgets a work as soon as he has completed it and starts to think=
 about the next one; if he thinks about his past work at all=2C he is more=
 likely to remember its faults than its virtues. Fame often makes a writer=
 vain=2C but seldom makes him proud.

[=E2=80=A6]

Every writer would rather be rich than poor=2C but no genuine writer cares=
 about popularity as such. He needs approval of his work by others in orde=
r to be reassured that the vision of life he believes he has had is a true=
 vision and not a self-delusion=2C but he can only be reassured by those w=
hose judgment he respects. It would only be necessary for a writer to secu=
re universal popularity if imagination and intelligence were equally distr=
ibuted among all men.

He then turns to the inner workings of the creative process and the mystiq=
ue of inspiration. Unlike Tchaikovsky=2C who drew a vehement line between=
 commissioned and self-initiated creative work (https://www.brainpickings.=
org/2012/08/24/tchaikovsky-on-the-paradox-of-patronage/?mc_cid=3De946a042e=
8&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) =2C Auden argues that all creative work is in a sens=
e commissioned =E2=80=94 not by a client but by the Muse=2C or by what Urs=
ula K. Le Guin so poetically called =E2=80=9Cacts of the spirit.=E2=80=9D=
 (https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/11/21/ursula-k-le-guin-where-do-you-g=
et-your-ideas/?mc_cid=3De946a042e8&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) He writes:

All works of art are commissioned in the sense that no artist can create o=
ne by a simple act of will but must wait until what he believes to be a go=
od idea for a work =E2=80=9Ccomes=E2=80=9D to him.

And yet what the Muse commissions is vulnerable to the basic flaw of all h=
uman intuition. =E2=80=9CThe confidence people have in their beliefs is no=
t a measure of the quality of evidence but of the coherence of the story t=
hat the mind has managed to construct=2C=E2=80=9D Nobel-winning psychologi=
st Daniel Kahneman wrote in exploring how our minds mislead us (https://ww=
w.brainpickings.org/2013/10/30/daniel-kahneman-intuition/?mc_cid=3De946a04=
2e8&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) . By the same token=2C the degree by which our ins=
piration invigorates us need not be indicative of the merit of the art it=
 produces. Auden articulates this with elegant wit:

The degree of excitement which a writer feels during the process of compos=
ition is as much an indication of the value of the final result as the exc=
itement felt by a worshiper is an indication of the value of his devotions=
=2C that is to say=2C very little indication.

But the task of assessing the merits of one=E2=80=99s own work is a Hercul=
ean one. In a passage that calls to mind Susan Sontag=E2=80=99s ideas abou=
t the four people a writer must be (https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/06/=
05/susan-sontag-on-writing-2/?mc_cid=3De946a042e8&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) and=
 Adam Phillips=E2=80=99s insight into the paradoxical nature of self-criti=
cism (https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/05/23/against-self-criticism-adam=
-phillips-unforbidden-pleasures/?mc_cid=3De946a042e8&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID])=
 =2C Auden offers his formula for effective creative critique of oneself:

To keep his errors down to a minimum=2C the internal Censor to whom a poet=
 submits his work in progress should be a Censorate. It should include=2C=
 for instance=2C a sensitive only child=2C a practical housewife=2C a logi=
cian=2C a monk=2C an irreverent buffoon and even=2C perhaps=2C hated by al=
l the others and returning their dislike=2C a brutal=2C foul-mouthed drill=
 sergeant who considers all poetry rubbish.

An ability to submit to this Censorate=2C of course=2C requires a high deg=
ree of sincerity =E2=80=94 something with which Nobel laureate Andr=C3=A9=
 Gide had memorably tussled (https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/03/13/andr=
e-gide-journals-sincerity/?mc_cid=3De946a042e8&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) a centu=
ry earlier and which Aldous Huxley believed was the cause of a supreme art=
istic anxiety (https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/03/28/aldous-huxley-art-=
artists-sincerity-obvious/?mc_cid=3De946a042e8&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) . Auden=
 quips=2C then turns sincere:

Sincerity is like sleep. Normally=2C one should assume that=2C of course=
=2C one will be sincere=2C and not give the question a second thought. Mos=
t writers=2C however=2C suffer occasionally from bouts of insincerity as m=
en do from bouts of insomnia. The remedy in both cases is often quite simp=
le: in the case of the latter=2C to change one=E2=80=99s diet=2C in the ca=
se of the former=2C to change one=E2=80=99s company.

[=E2=80=A6]

Sincerity in the proper sense of the word=2C meaning authenticity=2C is=2C=
 however=2C or ought to be=2C a writer=E2=80=99s chief preoccupation. No w=
riter can ever judge exactly how good or bad a work of his may be=2C but h=
e can always know=2C not immediately perhaps=2C but certainly in a short w=
hile=2C whether something he has written is authentic =E2=80=94 in his han=
dwriting =E2=80=94 or a forgery.

Echoing Montaigne=E2=80=99s admonition against the cult of originality (ht=

ion/?mc_cid=3De946a042e8&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) =2C Auden adds:

 with originality=2C which they should never bother about.

Half a century after German philosopher Josef Pieper argued that leisure i=

We have a word for free time: leisure. Leisure is time off the books=2C of=
f the job=2C off the clock. If we save time=2C we commonly believe we are=
 saving it for our leisure. We know that leisure is really a state of mind=
=2C but no dictionary can define it without reference to passing time. It=
 is unrestricted time=2C unemployed time=2C unoccupied time. Or is it? Uno=

 variety of experience attacks our leisure as it attempts to satiate us. W=

[=E2=80=A6]

Sociologists in several countries have found that increasing wealth and in=
creasing education bring a sense of tension about time. We believe that we=
 possess too little of it: that is a myth we now live by.

mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) =2C a minimalist illustrated meditation on our fraught=
 relationship with time

To fully appreciate Gleick=E2=80=99s insightful prescience=2C it behooves=
 us to remember that he is writing long before the social web as we know i=
t=2C before the conspicuous consumption of =E2=80=9Ccontent=E2=80=9D becam=
e the currency of the BuzzMalnourishment industrial complex=2C before the=
 timelines of Twitter and Facebook came to dominate our record and experie=
nce of time. (Prescience=2C of course=2C is a form of time travel =E2=80=
=94 perhaps our only nonfictional way to voyage into the future.) Gleick w=
rites:

We live in the buzz. We wish to live intensely=2C and we wonder about the=
 consequences =E2=80=94 whether=2C perhaps=2C we face the biological dilem=
ma of the waterflea=2C whose heart beats faster as the temperature rises.=
 This creature lives almost four months at 46 degrees Fahrenheit but less=
 than one month at 82 degrees.

[=E2=80=A6]

Yet we have made our choices and are still making them. We humans have cho=
sen speed and we thrive on it =E2=80=94 more than we generally admit. Our=
 ability to work fast and play fast gives us power. It thrills us=E2=80=A6=
 No wonder we call sudden exhilaration a rush.

Gleick considers what our units of time reveal about our units of thought:

We have reached the epoch of the nanosecond. This is the heyday of speed.=
 =E2=80=9CSpeed is the form of ecstasy the technical revolution has bestow=
ed on man=2C=E2=80=9D laments the Czech novelist Milan Kundera=2C suggesti=
ng by ecstasy a state of simultaneous freedom and imprisonment=E2=80=A6 Th=
at is our condition=2C a culmination of millennia of evolution in human so=
cieties=2C technologies=2C and habits of mind.

[=E2=80=A6]

Particle physicists may freeze a second=2C open it up=2C and explore its d=
appled contents like surgeons pawing through an abdomen=2C but in real lif=
e=2C when events occur within thousandths of a second=2C our minds cannot=
 distinguish past from future. What can we grasp in a nanosecond =E2=80=94=
 a billionth of a second? =E2=80=A6 Within the millisecond=2C the bat pres=
ses against the ball; a bullet finds time to enter a skull and exit again;=
 a rock plunges into a still pond=2C where the unexpected geometry of the=
 splash pattern pops into existence. During a nanosecond=2C balls=2C bulle=
ts=2C and droplets are motionless.

n a single second

If the nanosecond seems too negligible to matter=2C it is only because we=
 are fundamentally blinded by the biological limits of our perception. (We=
 are=2C for instance=2C only just beginning to understand the monumental i=
mportance of the microbiome (https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/08/10/i-co=
ntain-multitudes-ed-yong/?mc_cid=3De946a042e8&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) =2C impe=
rceptible to the naked eye yet crucial to nearly every aspect of our bodil=
y existence.) In 1849=2C when trailblazing astronomer Maria Mitchell (http=
s://www.brainpickings.org/2016/08/01/maria-mitchell-diary-spider/?mc_cid=
=3De946a042e8&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) became the first woman hired by the U.S.=
 federal government for a non-domestic specialized skill=2C she labored as=
 a =E2=80=9Ccomputer of Venus=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94 a sort of one-woman GPS=
=2C performing mathematically rigorous celestial calculations to help sail=
ors navigate the globe. The nanosecond was still decades away from being m=
easured and named=2C so her calculations=2C however adroit=2C were crude b=
y modern standards. Today=2C as Gleick points out=2C an error of one nanos=
econd
translates into a misplacement by one foot in modern GPS systems. This mea=
ns that just a dozen nanoseconds can steer you the wrong way altogether.

But perhaps the most striking illustration of just how frantically we=E2=
=80=99ve fragmented time and how insistently we=E2=80=99ve imbued the frag=
ments with restlessness comes from an unlikely source =E2=80=94 a mid-cent=
ury social science study published in 1959 under the title =E2=80=9CAssoci=
ation of Specific Overt Behavior Pattern with Blood and Cardiovascular Fin=
dings=2C=E2=80=9D the validity of which has since failed to hold up agains=
t scientific scrutiny but the linguistic legacy of which has only grown in=
 the half-century since: In addition to originating the notion of =E2=80=
=9Churry sickness=2C=E2=80=9D this study also coined the term =E2=80=9CTyp=
e A=2C=E2=80=9D which has since planted itself firmly and anxiously in our=
 collective conscience.

Gleick writes:

This magnificently bland coinage=2C put forward by a pair of California ca=
rdiologists in 1959=2C struck a collective nerve and entered the language.=
 It is a token of our confusion: are we victims or perpetrators of the cri=
me of haste? Are we living at high speed with athleticism and vigor=2C or=
 are we stricken by hurry sickness?

The cardiologists=2C Meyer Friedman and Ray Rosenman=2C listed a set of pe=
rsonality traits which=2C they claimed=2C tend to go hand in hand with one=
 another and also with heart disease. They described these traits rather u=
nappealingly=2C as characteristics about and around the theme of impatienc=
e. Excessive competitiveness. Aggressiveness. =E2=80=9CA harrying sense of=
 time urgency.=E2=80=9D The Type A idea emerged in technical papers and th=
en formed the basis of a popular book and made its way into dictionaries.

The archetypal Type A was a person the researchers called =E2=80=9CPaul=2C=
=E2=80=9D whom they described unambiguously:

A very disproportionate amount of his emotional energy is consumed in stru=
ggling against the normal constraints of time. =E2=80=9CHow can I move fas=
ter=2C and do more and more things in less and less time?=E2=80=9D is the=
 question that never ceases to torment him. Paul hurries his thinking=2C h=
is speech and his movements. He also strives to hurry the thinking=2C spee=
ch=2C and movements of those about him; they must communicate rapidly and=
 relevantly if they wish to avoid creating impatience in him. Planes must=
 arrive and depart precisely on time for Paul=2C cars ahead of him on the=
 highway must maintain a speed he approves of=2C and there must never be a=
 queue of persons standing between him and a bank clerk=2C a restaurant ta=
ble=2C or the interior of a theater. In fact=2C he is infuriated whenever=
 people talk slowly or circuitously=2C when planes are late=2C cars dawdle=
 on the highway=2C and queues form.

The study ultimately didn=E2=80=99t live up to its hypothesis that a Type=

d for a term that confers validity about an experience so prevalent and so=
 intimately familiar to so many. (In her beautiful essay on language and c=

If the Type A phenomenon made for poor medical research=2C it stands nonet=
heless as a triumph of social criticism. Some of us yield more willingly t=
o impatience than others=2C but on the whole Type A is who we are=E2=80=94=
not just the coronary-prone among us=2C but all of us=2C as a society and=
 as an age. No wonder the concept has proven too rich a cultural totem to=
 be dismissed. We understand it. We know it when we see it. Type A people=
 walk fast and eat fast. They finish your sentences for you. They feel gui=
lty about relaxing. They try to do two or more things at once=E2=80=A6

Perhaps the most perfect place to study the psychological machinery of the=
 Type A person is the elevator =E2=80=94 the social life of small urban sp=
aces (https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/08/22/the-social-life-of-small-ur=

 (https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/01/13/asch-elevator-experiment/?mc_ci=
d=3De946a042e8&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) ). Gleick explains:

Among the many aggravators of Type A-ness in modern life=2C elevators stan=
d out. By its very nature=2C elevatoring =E2=80=94 short-range vertical tr=
ansportation=2C as the industry calls it =E2=80=94 is a pressure-driven bu=
siness. Although there are still places on earth where people live full li=
ves without ever seeing an elevator=2C the Otis Elevator Company estimates=
 that its cars raise and lower the equivalent of the planet=E2=80=99s whol=
e population every nine days. This is a clientele that dislikes waiting.

946a042e8&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) by Isobel Harris=2C 1949

Gleick cites a curious and revealing passage from a 1979 report by Otis re=
searchers studying elevator behavior:

Waiting=2C some stand still=2C others pace=2C and another may make small g=
estures of impatience such as foot tapping=2C jiggling change in a pocket=
=2C scanning the walls and ceiling with apparent concentration=E2=80=A6 At=
 intervals=2C nearly everyone regards the elevator location display above=
 the doors by tipping their head slightly back and raising their eyes=E2=
=80=A6 Men=2C but hardly ever women=2C may rock gently back and forth=E2=
=80=A6

The long silences=2C the almost library hush=2C that we can observe where=
 people wait for elevators are not only what they seem=E2=80=A6 The longer=
 the silence the more likely one or more of us will become slightly embarr=
assed=E2=80=A6 the more embarrassing and tense are the little interior dra=
mas that we play out each within our own theater of projection=E2=80=A6

The actual period of waiting that elapses before a particular group may fe=
el that waiting has become a nearly unendurable torment will probably vary=
 significantly with the composition of the group=2C the time of day=2C and=
 the type of building in which they are traveling=E2=80=A6 The wait is har=
dly ever long=2C however much the subjective experience may stretch it out=
=2E

What makes the elevator so upsetting to the Type A person is that it force=
s upon us perpetually moving moderns the anxiety of stillness=2C a punishi=
ng counterpoint to the self-elected exhilaration of speed. An interesting=
=2C if discomfiting=2C thing to consider: At the time of Gleick=E2=80=99s=
 writing=2C elevator riders tended to fill that anxious space of time with=
 bodily fidgeting=2C occasional small talk=2C and no doubt large quantitie=
s of quiet inner rage; today=2C the average elevator is filled with people=
 hunched over their devices=2C heads bent=2C looking like a congregation o=
f mourners =E2=80=94 an alarmingly apt image=2C for we are now irreversibl=
y bereaved of that bygone era of innocent fidget-filled idleness=2C unburd=
ened by the tyrannical impulse for productivity. We no longer allow oursel=
ves boredom=2C that crucible of creativity (https://www.brainpickings.org/=
2015/03/16/boredom/?mc_cid=3De946a042e8&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) =2C even in th=
e elevator.

Building engineers have long tried to address the collective malady of ele=
vator impatience =E2=80=94 a problem only exacerbated as buildings grow ta=
ller and taller=2C requiring a greater number of elevators to prevent infu=
riating elevator traffic jams. For a while=2C a fanciful solution gained t=
raction: A pressurized =E2=80=9Csky lobby=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94 a transit poi=
nt in a skyscraper=2C wherein an air lock repressurizes elevator passenger=
s before they plunge into a rapid descent. But as abstract and at times il=
lusory as time may seem=2C it grounds us mercilessly into the creaturely r=
eality of our biology=2C which put an end to the sky lobby idea. Gleick wr=
ites:

One small problem resists solution. Evolution neglected to armor the human=
 eardrum against the sudden change in air pressure that comes with a fall=
 of hundreds of feet at high speed. Natural selection rarely had the oppor=
tunity to work with survivors of this experience=2C to fine-tune their eus=
tachian tubes in preparain for vertical transport. So at mid-century=2C wh=
en Frank Lloyd Wright designed a mile-high tower with 528 stories=2C helic=
opter landing pads=2C and quintuple-deck elevators running on atomic power=
=2C airline pilots instantly wrote to alert him to the impracticality. The=
 age of high-altitude passenger aviation was just beginning=2C and the pil=
ots knew that elevators descending thousands of feet within a minute or tw=
o would subject their passengers to severe inner-ear pain. Sure enough=2C=
 decades later=2C the Sears Tower in Chicago had to slow its observation-d=
eck elevators because at least one passenger had complained of a broken ea=
r drum =E2=80=94 an extreme manifestation of hurry
sickness.

What remained was the low-tech solution of manipulating the psychology of=
 human impatience=2C most palpably triggered by what engineers call =E2=80=
=9Cdoor dwell=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94 the amount of time it takes the elevator=
 doors to automatically close after making a stop on a given floor=2C prog=
rammed to last anywhere between two and four seconds. There is=2C of cours=
e=2C a way to override the automatic door dwell and win back=2C as it were=
=2C some of those precious blinks: the =E2=80=9CDOOR CLOSE=E2=80=9D button=
 =E2=80=94 a Type A favorite and typically the most worn out one in elevat=
ors=2C for people press it compulsively and repeatedly despite the negligi=
ble time-saving benefits and the knowledge that pushing it three times in=
 antsy succession is no more effective than pushing it once. Gleick consid=
ers the curious compulsion of poking this seductive yet temporally impoten=
t button:

Although elevators leave the factory with all their functions ready to wor=
k=2C the manufacturers realize that building managers often choose to disa=
ble DOOR CLOSE. Buildings fear trapped limbs and lawsuits. Thus they turn=
 their resident populations into subjects in a Pavlovian experiment in neg=
ative feedback. The subjects hunger for something even purer than food: sp=
eed.

[=E2=80=A6]

How many times will you continue to press a button that does nothing? Do y=
ou press elevator call buttons that are already lighted =E2=80=94 despite=
 your suspicion that=2C once the button has been pressed=2C no amount of f=
urther attention will hasten the car=E2=80=99s arrival? Your suspicion is=
 accurate. The computers could instruct elevators to give preference to fl=
oors with many calls. But elevator engineers know better than to provide a=
ny greater incentive than already exists for repeated pressing of the butt=
on. They remember Pavlov. They know what happens to those dogs.
