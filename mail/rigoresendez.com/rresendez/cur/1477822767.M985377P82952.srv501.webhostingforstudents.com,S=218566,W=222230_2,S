Needleman writes:

Among the great questions of the human heart=2C none is more central than=
 the question=2C =E2=80=9CWho am I?=E2=80=9D And among the great answers o=
f the human spirit=2C none is more central than the experience of =E2=80=
=9CI Am.=E2=80=9D In fact=2C in the course of an intensely lived human lif=
e =E2=80=94 a normal human life filled with the search for Truth =E2=80=94=
 this question and this answer eventually run parallel to each other=2C co=
ming closer and closer together until the question becomes the answer and=
 the answer becomes the question.

Needleman first confronted this question when he was eleven years old=2C t=
hanks to a neighborhood boy named Elias Barkhordian=2C who became his dear=
est childhood friend and most indefatigable comrade in intellectual inquir=
y. The two would sit together after school for hours on end=2C discussing=
 astronomy and spirituality with equal rigor of openhearted curiosity. But=
 it was Elias=E2=80=99s untimely death=2C as much as his short life=2C tha=
t catapulted Needleman=E2=80=99s existential puzzlements into new heights=
 of understanding. More than half a century later=2C he writes:

Elias died from leukemia=2C at that time incurable=2C just before his four=
teenth birthday. In the months that followed the onset of his illness=2C I=
 would meet with him in the quiet music room at the back of his house=2C f=
acing a large=2C carefully tended=2C sunshine-filled garden. As his illnes=
s progressed and he grew weaker=2C my feeling about his mind deepened. He=
 spoke openly about what awaited him and regretted only that he would not=
 live long enough to understand everything that he wished to understand ab=
out the universe. But somehow=2C doubtless because of the more frequent ap=
pearance in us of shared conscious presence=2C his death eventually=2C in=
 the years that followed=2C brought me more hope than grief=2C the hope th=
at arises from the =E2=80=9Csound=E2=80=9D of a truly sacred consciousness=
 calling to us from within ourselves.

I see now that it is the intimation of this quality of hope that I have al=
l along been trying to bring both to myself and to my students and readers=
 in the face of the illusory hopes and inevitable pessimism so characteris=
tic of our era.

To explore these questions=2C Needleman structures the book in the classic=
 style of a Socratic dialogue=2C but modernizes and enlivens the form with=
 the imaginative twist of staging a conversation between his childhood sel=
f=2C Jerry=2C and his present 80-year-old self=2C Jacob. I am reminded her=
e of Joan Didion=E2=80=99s memorable quip that =E2=80=9Cwe are well advise=
d to keep on nodding terms with the people we used to be=2C whether we fin=
d them attractive company or not=E2=80=9D (https://www.brainpickings.org/2=

=3D[UNIQID]) =E2=80=94 advice often difficult to implement as we wince at=
 the petulance=2C foolishness=2C and hubris of our former selves=2C yet so=
mething Needleman accomplishes with tremendous grace=2C warmth=2C and gene=
rosity of spirit toward the imperfect=2C impatient boy he once was.

Jacob Needleman (Photograph: David Ulrich)

In one of these exchanges=2C Jacob articulates to Jerry the central premis=
e of the book itself:

The struggle to exist=2C to not disappear in this moment=2C is the advanci=
ng root of the struggle to exist throughout the whole passage of time. We=
 need to help each other in this struggle. You by asking=2C I by strugglin=
g to respond. This is the law of love=2C which rules the universe.

In another=2C reminiscent of Alfred Kazin=E2=80=99s beautiful case for emb=
racing contradiction (https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/07/20/alfred-kazi=
n-journals-perception-contradiction/?utm_source=3DBrain+Pickings&utm_campa=

ID]) =2C Jacob exhorts Jerry:

Stay with the contradiction. If you stay=2C you will see that there is alw=
ays something more than two opposing truths. The whole truth always includ=
es a third part=2C which is the reconciliation.

The willingness to sit with contradiction=2C Needleman argues=2C is the be=
ginning of true self-knowledge and of the deepest kind of truthfulness. Ec=

 Jerry:

This is the beginning of sincerity.

Because you are struggling=2C your question begins to deepen=E2=80=A6 What=
 you will discover=2C always for the first time=2C always new=2C in the fl=
eeting moment of wonder =E2=80=94 before that moment is captured by the am=
bitions of personality. You=2C I=2C in that moment=2C will discover the ne=
ed to serve the energy=2C uniquely human and also sacred=2C that starts as=
 the pure awareness of one=E2=80=99s own existence. And even as this idea=
 =E2=80=94 this beginning idea =E2=80=94 of what is human=2C even as this=
 idea of what is man=2C begins to appear =E2=80=94 even in that fleeting m=
oment of the pure awareness of my existence given now by a great idea =E2=
=80=94 in that moment in front of a living idea=2C an awakening idea=2C a=
 glimpse appears of the uniquely human yearning to serve; the need appears=
=2C the need to obey that energy=2C the need to attend to it=2C to be nour=
ished by it=2C to receive the help that comes then and only then=2C when y=
ou are objectively obliged to give=2C to serve=2C to manifest that energy=
 in action and understanding. It is only that energy
of conscious existence that gives you=2C a human being=2C real strength. T=
he energy that is the total awareness of one=E2=80=99s own existence is=
 =E2=80=94 or can become=2C can be =E2=80=94 the strongest energy in human=
 life.

In another exchange=2C Jacob steers Jerry toward the idea that acknowledgi=
ng the illusoriness of free will liberates us rather than taking away our=
 freedom (https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/07/25/sam-harris-free-will/?u=

 is to understand freedom without understanding the influences acting upon=
 us=2C the laws of the universe=2C and the nature of reality=2C he conside=
rs the source of real freedom:

Ask yourself what is your understanding of the influences acting upon us=
 =E2=80=94 of the universal laws in nature? What are your thoughts about t=
hat? And the teachings of religion =E2=80=94 the idea of faith=2C obedienc=
e to the higher=2C responsibility for others and oneself=2C the deceptions=
 and revelations of sleep and dreaming=2C the very idea of man=E2=80=99s p=

ences of symbols=2C the cosmic and intimate force of sex=2C the inevitabil=
ity of death=2C the illusion and the reality of time.

[=E2=80=A6]

Working like this=2C and maintaining the fundamental attitude of sincerity=
 about yourself and your discoveries=2C you will become disillusioned not=
 only with your certainties=2C but with the structure of your mind itself.=
 You will realize that what you need is not new beliefs=2C new information=
=2C new theories=2C but an entirely new mind.

Such dissolution of certainty=2C Needleman argues=2C is the gateway to rea=
l freedom:

Real ideas open the mind to the heart=2C to the heart of the mind=2C to an=
other level of reality within ourselves=E2=80=A6 This is the taste=2C the=
 beginning=2C of inner freedom. Only fools imagine that freedom means gett=
ing what one happens to desire. Real freedom begins with obedience to a hi=
gher influence =E2=80=94 a higher=2C finer energy within oneself.

[=E2=80=A6]

What is higher in yourself? That way of thinking about the question is the=
 beginning of the answer =E2=80=94 because it involves a real idea which h=
as been handed down to humanity over thousands of years=E2=80=A6 At such a=
 point you yourself will find the answer =E2=80=94 not as a thought=2C but=
 as an experience.

You will for a moment become the answer! You will not only have a taste of=
 real freedom; you will for a moment be freedom.

How to cultivate such a capacity for self-erasure in the service of self-t=
ranscendence and self-liberation is what Needleman goes on to explore in t=

I knew from the age of six or seven that I wanted to be an artist. My moth=
er punished me for many things=2C but she encouraged me in this one way. A=
rt was holy to her.

[=E2=80=A6]

My first paintings were of my dreams. They were more real to me than the r=
eality I was living in =E2=80=94 I didn=E2=80=99t like my reality. I remem=

She recounts:

Deep shame=2C maximum self-consciousness. When I was young it was impossib=

What happened?

Art happened.

Abramovi=C4=87=2C age 15=2C Istria

Art became a life-straw for Abramovi=C4=87 =E2=80=94 a hedge against the l=
oneliness and sadness of her home life. Amid her mother=E2=80=99s suffocat=
ing and punishing control=2C art became the one domain where she felt she=
 had absolute freedom =E2=80=94 the freedom of expression.

Abramovi=C4=87=2C age 22=2C at her painting studio in Belgrade

At twenty-four=2C Abramovi=C4=87 was still living at home with her mother=
 =E2=80=94 not at all uncommon in Eastern Europe =E2=80=94 and still had t=
o abide by a 10pm curfew. But she immersed herself in art=2C painted obses=
sively=2C and was admitted into Belgrade=E2=80=99s Academy of Fine Arts. S=
he was the only woman in her art collective.

Abramovi=C4=87=2C age 24=2C with her art collective at Belgrade=E2=80=99s=
 Student Cultural Center

Together=2C they would spend hours talking about =E2=80=9Ca way past paint=
ing: a way to put life itself into art.=E2=80=9D This way became performan=
ce art=2C and Abramovi=C4=87 threw herself wholeheartedly=2C wholebodily i=
nto it. By her mid-twenties=2C she had made a name for herself in Belgrade=
=2E In 1972=2C a Scottish curator traversed the Iron Curtain in search of or=
iginal ideas for the famed Edinburgh Festival the following summer and was=
 captivated by her work. He invited Abramovi=C4=87 to show at the festival=
 =E2=80=94 an invitation into what was practically another world: the West=
=2E

Abramovi=C4=87 arrived in Edinburg thrilled and terrified in equal measure=
=2E She recalls:

It was my first trip to the West as an artist. I felt like a very small fi=
sh in a very big pond.

The piece she chose to perform=2C titled Rhythm 10=2C was a play on a drin=
king game popular among Russian and Yugoslav peasants: The player spreads=
 their fingers onto a wooden surface and=2C using a sharp knife=2C begins=
 rapidly stabbing the wood in the gap between the fingers. Whenever they m=
iss and knick or stab themselves=2C they take a shot; the more shots they=
 take=2C the more they lose control and cut themselves =E2=80=94 an expone=
ntially accelerating machine for self-inflicted pain. Abramovi=C4=87=E2=80=
=99s piece subverted this mechanism by placing the artist at the locus of=
 control =E2=80=94 she would go through the rapid motions deliberately=2C=
 using ten different knives in succession=2C so that whenever she stabbed=
 herself=2C the pain would be a testament to absolute presence.

flects on her initiation into her own self as an artist:

Some big part of me is thrilled by the unknown=2C by the idea of taking ri=

o for it.

That doesn=E2=80=99t mean I=E2=80=99m fearless. Quite the opposite. The id=
ea of death terrifies me. When there is turbulence on an airplane=2C I sha=
ke with fear. I start composing my last will and testament. But when it co=
mes to my work=2C I cast caution to the winds.

[=E2=80=A6]

I could hardly breathe from the idea that I was going to do this. But I wa=
s also serious about what I was about to do=2C 100 percent committed. I wa=
s so serious about everything then! Yet I think I needed this gravity. Muc=
h later on=2C I read a statement of Bruce Nauman=E2=80=99s: =E2=80=9CArt i=

=80=99s so true. This was exactly how it was for me=2C even at the beginni=
ng. Art was life and death. There was nothing else. It was so serious=2C a=

The determination that carried her through the performance embodies Nicole=
 Krauss=E2=80=99s beautiful assertion that =E2=80=9Cbravery is always more=

 Abramovi=C4=87 faced the white paper onto which she had performed it=2C=
 =E2=80=9Cstained very impressively=E2=80=9D with her own blood =E2=80=94=
 the very blood that had been one of her biggest fears during her violent=
 childhood. The self-harm was in a way self-healing. It was also her first=
 awareness of what art does =E2=80=94 its supreme power of self-transcende=
nce=2C for artist and viewer alike=2C and a powerful channel of communion=
 between the two. She writes:

The crowd stared=2C dead silent. And a very strange feeling came over me=
=2C something I had never dreamed of: It was as if electricity was running=
 through my body=2C and the audience and I had become one. A single organi=
sm. The sense of danger in the room had united the onlookers and me in tha=
t moment: the here and now=2C and nowhere else.

That thing that each of us lives with=2C that you are your own little self=
 privately =E2=80=94 once you step into the performance space=2C you are a=
cting from a higher self=2C and it=E2=80=99s not you anymore. It=E2=80=99s=
 not the you that you know. It=E2=80=99s something else. There on the gymn=
asium floor of Melville College in Edinburgh=2C Scotland=2C it was as if I=
 had become=2C at the same time=2C a receiver and transmitter of huge=2C T=
esla-like energy. The fear was gone=2C the pain was gone. I had become a M=
arina whom I didn=E2=80=99t know yet.

For Abramovi=C4=87=2C the experience was also a homecoming of sorts =E2=80=
=94 using pain as a focal point of presence=2C she had attained a taste of=
 that coveted freedom=2C the freedom of expression=2C which had first draw=
n her to art as a child. She reflects:

Listening to the wild applause from the audience=2C I knew I=E2=80=99d suc=
ceeded in creating an unprecedented unity of time present and time past wi=

 its ultimate purpose:

During the final month=2C as this piece became one with life itself=2C I s=
tarted to think intensely about the purpose of my existence. Eight hundred=
 fifty thousand people in all had stood in the atrium=2C seventeen thousan=
d on the final day alone. And I was there for everyone there=2C whether th=
ey sat with me or not. Suddenly=2C out of nowhere in the world=2C this ove=
rwhelming need had appeared. The responsibility was enormous.

I was there for everyone who was there. A great trust had been given to me=
 =E2=80=94 a trust that I didn=E2=80=99t dare abuse=2C in any way. Hearts=
 were opened to me=2C and I opened my heart in return=2C time after time a=
fter time. I opened my heart to each one=2C then closed my eyes =E2=80=94=
 and then there was always another. My physical pain was one thing. But th=
e pain in my heart=2C the pain of pure love=2C was far greater.

[=E2=80=A6]

The sheer quantity of love=2C the unconditional love of total strangers=2C=
 was the most incredible feeling I=E2=80=99ve ever had. I don=E2=80=99t kn=
ow if this is art=2C I said to myself. I don=E2=80=99t know what this is=
=2C or what art is. I=E2=80=99d always thought of art as something that wa=
s expressed through certain tools: painting=2C sculpture=2C photography=2C=
 writing=2C film=2C music=2C architecture. And yes=2C performance. But thi=
s performance went beyond performance. This was life. Could art=2C should=
 art=2C be isolated from life? I began to feel more and more strongly that=
 art must be life =E2=80=94 it must belong to everybody. I felt=2C more po=
werfully than ever=2C that what I had created had a purpose.

 age=2C there was little correlation between aptitude and opportunity for=
 women in 19th-century Europe. At the end of her long life=2C she would re=
count=2C not bitterly but wistfully:

Thinking back to =E2=80=A6 the time of my youth=2C one realizes with some=
 astonishment how many problems then existed in the lives of ordinary youn=
g girls=2C which now seem almost unimaginable. Among the most difficult of=
 these problems was the possibility of normal intellectual training.

Sime herself=2C who spent decades as the only woman at her university depa=

Meitner never married nor had children and=2C as far as her personal paper=
s indicate=2C never had a serious romance. But her life was a full one=2C=
 warmed by deep human connection =E2=80=94 she was an exceptionally devote=

=80=99s own words=2C as =E2=80=9Cgreat and lovable personalities=E2=80=9D=
 who provided a =E2=80=9Cmagic musical accompaniment=E2=80=9D to her life.=
 Above all=2C she was besotted with science =E2=80=94 so much so that she=
 patiently chipped away at and eventually broke through every imaginable o=
bstruction to pursuing her passion.

Since her formal schooling had ended at the age of fourteen=2C Meitner spe=
nt a few years repressing her scientific ambitions. But they burned in her=
 with irrepressible ardor. Finally=2C when Austrian universities began adm=
itting women in 1901=2C she obtained her high school certification at the=
 age of twenty-three after compressing eight years=E2=80=99 worth of logic=
=2C literature=2C mathematics=2C Greek=2C Latin=2C botany=2C zoology=2C an=
d physics into twenty months of study in order to take the examination tha=
t would qualify her for university. She received her Ph.D. in 1905=2C one=
 of a handful of women in the world to have achieved a doctorate in physic=
s by that point.

But when 29-year-old Meitner traveled to Berlin=2C hoping to study with th=
e great Max Planck=2C she seemed to have entered a time machine =E2=80=94=
 German universities still had their doors firmly shut to women. She had t=
o ask for a special permission to attend Planck=E2=80=99s lectures.

In the fall of 1907=2C she met Otto Hahn =E2=80=94 a German chemist four m=
onths her junior=2C as interested in radioactivity as she was=2C and unopp=
osed to working with women. But women were forbidden from entering=2C much=
 less working at=2C Berlin=E2=80=99s Chemical Institute=2C so in order to=
 collaborate=2C Meitner and Hahn had to work in a former carpentry shop co=
nverted into a lab in the basement of the building. Hahn was allowed to cl=
imb up the floors=2C but Meitner was not =E2=80=94 a hard fact that fringe=
s on metaphor.

Meitner and Hahn in their basement laboratory=2C 1913

The two scientists filled each other=E2=80=99s gaps with their respective=
 aptitudes =E2=80=94 Meitner=2C trained in physics=2C was a brilliant math=
ematician who thought conceptually and could design highly original experi=

hn emerged as pioneers in the study of radioactivity. Eventually=2C Meitne=
r gained independence from Hahn =E2=80=94 she published fifty-six papers o=
n her own between 1921 and 1934.

But as her career was taking off=2C the Nazis began usurping Europe. Meitn=
er and Hahn=E2=80=99s third collaborator=2C a junior scientist named Fritz=
 Strassmann=2C had already gotten in trouble for refusing to join Nazi org=
anizations. In 1938=2C just as the three scientists were performing their=
 most visionary experiments=2C Nazi troops marched into Austria. Meitner r=
efused to hide her Jewish heritage. Her only remaining option was to leave=
=2C but the Nazis had already put anti-Semitic laws in place prohibiting u=
niversity professors from exiting the country. On July 13=2C with the help=
 of Hahn and a few other scientist friends=2C Meitner made a narrow escape=
 across the Dutch border. From Holland=2C she migrated to Denmark=2C where=
 she stayed with her friend Niels Bohr. She finally found a permanent home=

Lise Meitner shortly before her exile

That November=2C Hahn and Meitner met secretly in Copenhagen to discuss so=
me perplexing results Hahn and Strassmann had obtained: After bombarding t=
he nucleus of a uranium atom (atomic number 92) with a single neutron=2C t=
hey had ended up with the nucleus of radium (atomic number 88) =E2=80=94 a=
 seemingly magical transmutation that didn=E2=80=99t make physical sense.=
 That a tiny neutron moving at low speed would destabilize and downright s=
hatter something as robust as an atom=2C knocking down its atomic number i=
nto a wholly different element=2C seemed as mythic as David taking out Gol=
iath with a slingshot.

At that point=2C Hahn was one of the world=E2=80=99s best radiochemists an=
d Meitner one of the world=E2=80=99s best physicists. She told him unequiv=
ocally that his chemical reaction made no sense on physical grounds and ur=
ged him to repeat the experiment.

Meitner herself continued to ponder the perplexity. The epiphany arrived o=
n Christmas day=2C during a walk with her nephew and collaborator=2C Otto=
 Robert Frisch. In recounting the occasion in his memoir=2C Frisch would i=
nadvertently provide the most perfect metaphor for how women make progress=
 in science relative to their male peers:

We walked up and down in the snow=2C I on skis and she on foot (she said a=
nd proved that she could get along just as fast that way).

In making sense of the nonsensical results=2C Meitner and Frisch came up w=
ith what they would call nuclear fission =E2=80=94 a word used for the ver=
y first time in the seventh paragraph of the paper they published the foll=
owing month. The notion that a nucleus can split and be transformed into a=
nother element was radical =E2=80=94 no one had fathomed it before. Meitne=
r had provided the first understanding of how and why this happened.

One could love one=E2=80=99s work and not always be tormented by the fear=

The discovery of fission itself was a supreme example of these beautiful s=
cientific findings =E2=80=94 a triumph of the human intellect over the mys=
teries of nature=2C as well as a testament to interpretation as a creative=
 act. The nonsensical empirical results were Hahn=E2=80=99s=2C but what ex=
tracted meaning from them was Meitner=E2=80=99s interpretation =E2=80=94 s=
he had dis-covered=2C in the proper sense of uncovering something obscured=
 from view=2C the underlying principle that made sense of the grand perple=
xity.

Hahn took her groundbreaking insight and ran with it=2C publishing the dis=
covery without mentioning her name. It is beside the point whether his rea=
sons were personal jealousies or the political cowardice of incensing the=
 Nazi authorities =E2=80=94 the point is that Meitner felt deeply betrayed=
 by the injustice. She wrote to her brother Walter:

I have no self confidence=E2=80=A6 Hahn has just published absolutely wond=
erful things based on our work together =E2=80=A6 much as these results ma=
ke me happy for Hahn=2C both personally and scientifically=2C many people=
 here must think I contributed absolutely nothing to it =E2=80=94 and now=
 I am so discouraged.

Lise Meitner at age 50

In 1944=2C the discovery of nuclear fission was awarded the Nobel Prize in=
 Chemistry =E2=80=94 to Hahn alone. Sime writes:

The distortion of reality and the suppression of memory are recurrent them=
es in any study of Nazi Germany and its aftermath. By any normal standard=
 of scientific attribution=2C there would have been no doubt about Meitner=
=E2=80=99s role in the discovery of fission. For it is clear from the publ=
ished record and from private correspondence that this was a discovery to=
 which Meitner contributed from beginning to end =E2=80=94 an inherently i=
nterdisciplinary discovery that would=2C without question=2C have been rec=
ognized as such=2C were it not for the artifact of Meitner=E2=80=99s force=
d emigration. But nothing about this discovery was untouched by the politi=
cs of Germany in 1938. The same racial policies that drove Meitner out of=
 Germany made it impossible for her to be part of Hahn and Strassmann=E2=
=80=99s publication=2C and dangerous for Hahn to acknowledge their continu=
ing ties. A few weeks after the discovery was made=2C Hahn claimed it for=
 chemistry alone; before long=2C he suppressed and denied not only his hid=
den
collaboration with a =E2=80=9Cnon-Aryan=E2=80=9D in exile but the value of=
 nearly everything she had done before as well. It was self-deception=2C b=
rought on by fear. Hahn=E2=80=99s dishonesty distorted the record of this=
 discovery and almost cost Lise Meitner her place in its history.

Meitner received countless accolades in her lifetime and even had a chemic=
al element=2C meitnerium=2C posthumously named after her=2C but the slight=
 was never righted. Although every imaginable roadblock had been placed be=
fore her in pursuing a scientific education=2C she had survived Nazi perse=
cution=2C and had endured the anguish of exile=2C she considered the Nobel=
 omission that most irredeemable sorrow of her life.

Sime writes:

Except for a few brief statements=2C she did not campaign on her own behal=
f; she did not write an autobiography=2C nor did she authorize a biography=
 during her lifetime. Only seldom did she speak of her struggle for educat=
ion and acceptance=2C although the insecurity and isolation of her formati=
ve years affected her deeply later on. And she almost never spoke of her f=
orced emigration=2C shattered career=2C or broken friendships. She would h=
ave preferred that the essentials of her life be gleaned from her scientif=
ic publications=2C but she knew that in her case that would not suffice.

[=E2=80=A6]

Scientist that she was=2C she preserved her data. Her rich collection of p=
ersonal papers=2C in addition to archival material from other sources=2C p=
rovides the basis for a detailed understanding of her work=2C her life=2C=
 and the exceptionally difficult period in which she lived.

Sime considers the more systemic implications of Meitner=E2=80=99s case:

To insist that Meitner contributed nothing to the fission discovery=2C to=
 imply that Meitner and Frisch had been given an unfair advantage =E2=80=
=94 these were ways of denying that she had been treated unjustly and=2C i=
n a larger sense=2C of refusing to confront the injustice and crimes of th=
e Nazi period. Rather than acknowledging that Meitner=E2=80=99s exclusion=
 from fission was political=2C Hahn and his hangers-on invented spurious s=
cientific reasons for it. Arrogantly=2C and with misplaced national pride=
=2C they denied the injustice=2C created new injustice =E2=80=94 and impli=
cated themselves.

Given the echo chamber of interpretive opinion we call history=2C Hahn=E2=
=80=99s view was readily echoed by his followers and=2C in turn=2C by gene=
rations of journalists and uncritical commentators on the history of scien=
ce. The Nobel exclusion was the most obvious=2C but the egregious erasure=
 of Meitner=E2=80=99s legacy didn=E2=80=99t end there. The fission apparat=
us =E2=80=94 the very instrument she had used in her Berlin laboratory to=
 make her discoveries =E2=80=94 was on display at Germany=E2=80=99s premie=
re science museum for thirty-five years without so much as mentioning her=
 name.

This=2C of course=2C was far from the last time that a woman was excluded=
 from a Nobel Prize for a discovery she either made or made possible with=
 her significant contribution: There is=2C perhaps most famously=2C Jocely=
n Bell Burnell=E2=80=99s discovery of pulsars (https://www.brainpickings.o=
