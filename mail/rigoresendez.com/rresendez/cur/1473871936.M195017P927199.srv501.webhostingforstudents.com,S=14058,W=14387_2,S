Rigoberto,

Wall Street, big corporations, and special interests all want to pass the =
disastrous Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal (TPP). They see the huge =
potential profits, and they're going to do everything they can to make =
sure it passes - and they especially hope it comes up for a vote in the =
lame duck session of Congress.

Working families want to defeat TPP because they know it means more of the =
same like other trade deals: more jobs moving overseas and more =
protections for corporations' reckless behavior.

Today is our day of action to defeat TPP, and we're setting an ambitious =
goal: we want Our Revolution supporters to help make 50,000 calls to =
Congress today.

Can you call your member of Congress and ask them to oppose TPP? Click =
here for talking points and to be connected to Congress.

CALL CONGRESS TO STOP TPP: =
https://ourrevolution-bernie16.bsd.net/page/content/tpp-calls/

You can also dial this number straight from your phone and contact your =
member of Congress:

1-844-311-2016

We're targeting calls to the House of Representatives because that is our =
best chance at winning the fight against TPP. If TPP passes Congress, =
that's it. It can't be changed. TPP can't be cancelled unless all 12 =
nations pull out. We must defeat it before it's too late.

Our Revolution is helping lead a huge coalition of labor and environmental =
groups with millions of members who are committed to defeating TPP. We're =
excited to have you as part of this effort.

Click here to be connected to Congress and to read talking points about =
TPP:

You can also call 1-844-311-2016 on your phone.

Thank you.

In solidarity,
