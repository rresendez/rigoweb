Hi

Yes, our next test in San Antonio is a week from today, Aug 27, at 9 am at Wayland Baptist Univ.

We do have space for you, and so invite you to make a reservation for the test with me at 210-637-6161 or by email to the above email address.

That invite goes for any questions you might have, either on the test or on Mensa and South Texas Mensa, the local group for that area.

Wayland is on IH 35 N on the outbound access road between Loops 410 and 1604, so is accessible from any part of town and is easy to find.

There is a charge of $40 to take the test, and a photo ID is required.  This has to be the first time you have taken the Mensa Admission Test series, the test we will be giving that day.  Yes, we do have another series called the non-language series which has three tests, while 
the MAT is a two-part series. Passing any one of the total of five tests qualifies you for membership.

How to pay:  Check or money order payable to American Mensa, or any of four credit cards, Visa, MasterCard, American Express. or Discover.

We want you in Mensa, and want to help make that happen.

Roy
