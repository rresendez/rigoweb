Hi

At the time of our first announcement of this test, I didn't have the building name, but do now, so:

Corpus Christi Test, Nov 12, 10 am to noon, on the fourth floor of the White Library on the Del Mar Ayres St campus.

Please call Sylvia Whitworth at 361-853-9990 or email her at jimcwhit@hotmail.com with reservations and questions regarding the location.

For questions on the test itself or Mensa in general, please call me at 210-637-6161 or email me at the From address above.

Please do make reservations, since we need to ensure that we bring enough material, or perish the thought, so that we know that you will be there and so not cancel the test.

We do want you in Mensa, it is an interesting organization with interesting members.

Thanks very much.

Roy
