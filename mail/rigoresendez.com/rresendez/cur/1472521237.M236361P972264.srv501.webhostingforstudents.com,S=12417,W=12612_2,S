Best regards,



Here is your response for your records:

Full name Rigoberto Resendez Email rresendez@rigoresendez.com Birthday  
1988-08-19 Gender Male Location Texas Are you free of work and other study  
commitments for the duration of the program No If you answered "no" to the  
previous question, briefly describe your other commitments. i enrolled for  
9 hours on utpa including ae comerce class with Joel Garza which i could  
overlap with this project. A sample of my Django/Python job can be found at  
http://rresendez.pythonanywhere.com/ What is the highest level of school  
you have completed or the highest degree you have received? Bachelor degree  
Which of the following categories best describes your employment status?  
Not employed, NOT looking for work Which race/ethnicity best describes you?  
Hispanic American What is the primary language spoken at home? Spanish Why  
are you applying to the (boot) Bootcamp? I'm in the IT master programs and  
I believe I do have a talent for coding. I was received the invitation at  
my utrgv mail. Tell us about your professional/educational career to date.  
What are you up to now and how did you end up there? I have a 3.9 GPA in MS  
on IT . Have completed Harvard CS50 have taken several courses with Khan  
Academy and Team tree house . I'm currently begining a nano degree on  
Android Development in Udacity developed by Google Describe your background  
with computer programming. Please be as detailed as possible. Feel free to  
include links to any applications you've built, courses you've completed,  
etc... Most of my old code exists at my webpage which I developed  
www.rigoresendez.com some of my most recent work in Django/python is here  
http://rresendez.pythonanywhere.com/ Also my php application to send free  
sms still works at http://rigoresendez.com/sms.php. Currently I'm working  
on a e-comerce webpage for jewelry for a family memeber i hope to implement  
bticoin payment since i took some lessons on bitcoin services as 21.co .  
The ability to think in a structured way, both creatively and  
quantitatively, to solve complex problems is an important element of being  
a successful developer. Can you tell us anything that demonstrates your  
abilities in that realm? (anything from standardized test scores to  
experience playing a musical instrument counts) I do play guitar, piano and  
bass . I did learn guitar by myself trough software , until the point I  
would perform live . While I was around 11 years old, I was given and IQ  
test and scored 135 . However ,to be honest that was a long time ago. I am  
that kind of ADHD that when focus can achieve anything . I have a passion  
for understanding , solving and creating .I love code , because you can  
build so much with so little. Is there anything else you'd like us to know?  
This is a link to my CV  
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5O4PWzeKQ1obTEtckhwY09NblE/view?usp=sharing.  
I hope you consider me . I know I have a lot to offer if given the right  
opportunity. I'm always helping my fellow students because they know I have  
a passion for understanding. Please let me become the best version of  
myself by helping you. The "C" in CSS stands for? Creative In a short  
paragraph explain the difference between backend and frontend. Back end  
deal with the processing that happens outside the client computer , most of  
times this code is to be hidden form the client for security reason. The  
front end is what happens on the client side including the user interface.  
How many times does the loop run? Three What's the final value of i? -1.5  
To the best of your knowledge explain what the code does. Enter "I don't  
know" if unable to answer. In each iteration "i" divides by 2 and then  
subtracts 2 this is done until "i" is less than 0
