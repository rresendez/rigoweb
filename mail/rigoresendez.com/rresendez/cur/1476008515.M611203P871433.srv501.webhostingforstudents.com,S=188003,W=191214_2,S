Here is Reyes=E2=80=99s story=2C as it appears in the book:

Working and living in migrant farmworkers=E2=80=99 fields=2C the condition=
s were pretty terrible. My parents were alcoholics=2C and I was beaten and=
 abused and neglected. I learned to fight with a knife long before I learn=
ed how to ride a bicycle.

When you are grinding day after day after day=2C there=E2=80=99s nothing t=
o aspire to except filling your hungry belly. You may walk down the street=
 and see a row of nice=2C clean houses=2C but you never=2C ever dream you=
 can live in one. You don=E2=80=99t dream. You don=E2=80=99t hope.

When I was twelve=2C a bookmobile came to the fields. I thought it was the=
 Baptists=2C because they used to come in a van and give us blankets and f=
ood. So I went over and peeked in=2C and it was filled with books. I immed=
iately =E2=80=94 and I do mean immediately =E2=80=94 stepped back. I wasn=
=E2=80=99t allowed to have books=2C because books are heavy=2C and when yo=
u=E2=80=99re moving a lot you have to keep things minimal. Of course=2C I=
 had read in the short periods I was allowed to go to school=2C but I=E2=
=80=99d not ever owned a book.

Fortunately=2C the staff member saw me and waved me in. I was nervous. The=
 bookmobile person said=2C =E2=80=9CThese are books=2C and you can take on=
e home. Just bring it back in two weeks.=E2=80=9D I=E2=80=99m like=2C =E2=
=80=9CWhat=E2=80=99s the catch?=E2=80=9D He explained there was no catch.=
 Then he asked me what I was interested in.

The night before=2C an elder had told us a story about the day that Mount=
 Rainier blew up and the devastation from the volcano. So I told the bookm=
obile person that I was nervous about the mountain blowing up=2C and he sa=
id=2C =E2=80=9CYou know=2C the more you know about something=2C the less y=
ou will fear it.=E2=80=9D And he gave me a book about volcanoes. Then I sa=
w a book about dinosaurs=2C and I said=2C =E2=80=9COh=2C that looks neat=
=2C=E2=80=9D so he gave me that. Then he gave me a book about a little boy=
 whose family were farmers. I took them all home and devoured them.

I came back in two weeks=2C and he gave me more books=2C and that started=
 it. By the time I was fifteen=2C I knew there was a world outside the cam=
ps=2C and I believed I could find a place in it. I had read about people l=
ike me and not like me. I had seen how huge the world was=2C and it gave m=
e the courage to leave. And I did. It taught me that hope was not just a w=
ord.

When I left=2C I went to vocational school=2C and I graduated with a steno=
grapher=E2=80=99s degree. Then=2C when Pierce County Library had an openin=
g=2C I applied and was hired. I got to spend thirty-two years helping othe=
r people make a connection with the library. I have a deep=2C abiding comm=
itment to them. Libraries save lives.

Composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein (August 25=2C 1918=E2=80=93Octobe=

gest spirits of the past century. He was awarded twenty-three Grammy Award=
s=2C ten Emmy Awards=2C and twenty-two honorary degrees. For Bernstein=2C=
 his life and his work=2C his art and his political convictions=2C coexist=
ed inseparably within the vast container of his unrelenting idealism. Duri=

On November 20=2C 1989 =E2=80=94 less than a year before his death =E2=80=
=94 Bernstein=2C who was otherwise averse to interviews=2C invited into hi=
s home longtime Rolling Stone contributing editor Jonathan Cott for a long=
 dinner conversation. A decade after conducting Susan Sontag=E2=80=99s mos=
t dimensional interview (https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/14/love-and=

he hand and walked the maestro across the landscape of his own life as Ber=
nstein reflected on everything from music to education to love.

Their beautifully layered and symphonic conversation was eventually publis=
hed as Dinner with Lenny: The Last Long Interview with Leonard Bernstein (=
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199858446/braipick-20?mc_cid=3D533=

740365&referer=3Dbrief_results?mc_cid=3D533d31dcb0&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) ).

Cott casts his subject:

Leonard Bernstein adamantly=2C and sometimes controversially=2C refused to=
 compartmentalize and separate his emotional=2C intellectual=2C political=
=2C erotic=2C and spiritual longings from the musical experience.

[=E2=80=A6]

Above all=2C in every aspect of his life and work=2C Bernstein was a bound=
less enthusiast. In the course of my dinner conversation with him=2C he in=
formed me that the word =E2=80=9Centhusiasm=E2=80=9D was derived from the=
 Greek adjective entheos=2C meaning =E2=80=9Chaving the god within=2C=E2=
=80=9D with its attendant sense of =E2=80=9Cliving without aging=2C=E2=80=
=9D as did the gods on Mount Olympus.

Bernstein=E2=80=99s greatest point of enthusiasm was his lifelong devotion=
 to enamoring young people with music. He understood that love and learnin=
g are inextricably linked=2C that learning is a kind of love and love a ki=
nd of learning=2C and used his robust and radiant enthusiasm as a force of=
 illumination. He tells Cott:

Though I can=E2=80=99t prove it=2C deep in my heart I know that every pers=
on is born with the love of learning. Without exception. Every infant stud=
ies its toes and fingers=2C and a child=E2=80=99s discovery of his or her=
 voice must be one of the most extraordinary of life=E2=80=99s moments=E2=
=80=A6 Imagine an infant lying in its cradle=2C discovering its voice=2C p=
urring and murmuring MMM to itself.

As we grow up and learn to be cynical=2C Bernstein argues=2C we gradually=
 stifle this inherent love of learning=2C turn off our curiosity=2C and be=
come calcified. Out of that cynicism springs the impulse for instant grati=
fication =E2=80=94 the very opposite of the pleasurably protracted challen=
ge of learning. A generation before the incessant input feed of the Intern=
et gave us continuous quick fixes of on-demand approval and outrage=2C Ber=
nstein considers the cultural and civilizational conditions that have cont=
ributed to this epidemic of instant gratification:

Everyone who was born after 1945 when that bomb went off is a completely d=
ifferent kind of person from those who were born before then. Because they=
 grew up in a world where the possibility of global destruction was an eve=
ryday possibility=2C to the point where they didn=E2=80=99t even think abo=
ut it that much. But it conditions the way they live=E2=80=A6 Anybody who=
 grows up =E2=80=94 as those of my generation did not =E2=80=94 taking the=
 possibility of the immediate destruction of the planet for granted is goi=
ng to gravitate all the more toward instant gratification =E2=80=94 you pu=
sh the TV button=2C you drop the acid=2C you snort the coke=2C you do the=
 needle=E2=80=A6 and then you pass out in the bed =E2=80=A6 and you wake u=
p so cynical=E2=80=A6 And guilt breeds fear and anxiety=2C and anxiety bre=
eds fear=2C and it goes around =E2=80=94 it=E2=80=99s that old vicious cir=
cle where one thing reinforces the other=2C which drives you day and night=
 to instant gratification. Anything of a serious nature isn=E2=80=99t =E2=

Leonard Bernstein in his final years

But rather than despairing over this nascent orientation of spirit=2C whic=
h would itself be an act of cynicism=2C Bernstein turns to the reasons for=
 hope =E2=80=94 hope he devoted his life to seeding and seeing bloom. (Act=
ive hope=2C lest we forget=2C is the antidote to cynicism (https://www.bra=
inpickings.org/2015/02/09/hope-cynicism/?mc_cid=3D533d31dcb0&mc_eid=3D[UN=

We must get back to faith and hope and belief =E2=80=94 things we=E2=80=99=
re all born with. But unfortunately we=E2=80=99re also born thinking we=E2=
=80=99re the center of the universe. And of all traumas=2C that one is the=
 biggest and most difficult to get rid of. And the hardest principle to ab=
sorb is the Copernican one: that you=E2=80=99re just another speck on this=
 planet=2C which is a speck in the solar system=2C which is a speck in the=
 galaxy=2C which is a speck in the universe =E2=80=A6 which is a speck in=
 something even bigger that we don=E2=80=99t have the minds to contemplate=
=2E

[=E2=80=A6]

No subject is too difficult to talk to the kids about. You just have to kn=
ow where the pain is.

When Cott brings up the Hasidic Rabbi Dov Baer=E2=80=99s assertion that=
 =E2=80=9Ceach person consists of a certain song of existence=2C the one b=
y which our innermost being was created and is defined=2C=E2=80=9D Bernste=
in responds:

We destroy our children=E2=80=99s songs of existence by giving them inhibi=

f it=E2=80=A6 You become hardened=2C but you can find that playfulness aga=
in. We=E2=80=99ve got to find a way to get music and kids together=2C as w=

 the infectious process begins.

QID]) =E2=80=94 Bernstein reflects on his life=E2=80=99s greatest passion:

Being with young people has kept me alive=2C I tell you=2C and I would do=
 anything for them. Think of what we can do with all that energy and all t=
hat spirit instead of eroding and degrading our planet on which we live=2C=
 and disgracing ourselves as a race. I will spend my dying breath and my l=
ast blood and erg of energy to try to correct this impossible situation.

[=E2=80=A6]

There is so much inherent goodness in people that if they aren=E2=80=99t i=
nhibited by traumas and are given half a chance=2C it shines through.

Bernstein died eleven months later=2C having handed this great chance-givi=

ickings.org/2016/02/29/arthur-rackham-brothers-grimm/?mc_cid=3D533d31dcb0&=
mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) of the Brothers Grimm fairy tales

But Wohlleben=E2=80=99s own career began at the opposite end of the caring=
 spectrum. As a forester tasked with optimizing the forest=E2=80=99s outpu=
t for the lumber industry=2C he self-admittedly =E2=80=9Cknew about as muc=
h about the hidden life of trees as a butcher knows about the emotional li=
fe of animals.=E2=80=9D He experienced the consequence of what happens whe=
never we turn something alive=2C be it a creature or a work of art=2C into=
 a commodity =E2=80=94 the commercial focus of his job warped how he looke=
d at trees.

Then=2C about twenty years ago=2C everything changed when he began organiz=
ing survival training and log-cabin tours for tourists in his forest. As t=
hey marveled at the majestic trees=2C the enchanted curiosity of their gaz=
e reawakened his own and his childhood love of nature was rekindled. Aroun=
d the same time=2C scientists began conducting research in his forest. Soo=
n=2C every day became colored with wonderment and the thrill of discovery=
 =E2=80=94 no longer able to see trees as a currency=2C he instead saw the=
m as the priceless living wonders that they are. He recounts:

Life as a forester became exciting once again. Every day in the forest was=
 a day of discovery. This led me to unusual ways of managing the forest. W=
hen you know that trees experience pain and have memories and that tree pa=
rents live together with their children=2C then you can no longer just cho=
p them down and disrupt their lives with large machines.

The revelation came to him in flashes=2C the most eye-opening of which hap=
pened on one of his regular walks through a reserve of old beech tree in h=
is forest. Passing by a patch of odd mossy stones he had seen many times b=
efore=2C he was suddenly seized with a new awareness of their strangeness.=
 When he bent down to examine them=2C he made an astonishing discovery:

The stones were an unusual shape: they were gently curved with hollowed-ou=
t areas. Carefully=2C I lifted the moss on one of the stones. What I found=
 underneath was tree bark. So=2C these were not stones=2C after all=2C but=
 old wood. I was surprised at how hard the =E2=80=9Cstone=E2=80=9D was=2C=
 because it usually takes only a few years for beechwood lying on damp gro=
und to decompose. But what surprised me most was that I couldn=E2=80=99t l=
ift the wood. It was obviously attached to the ground in some way. I took=
 out my pocketknife and carefully scraped away some of the bark until I go=
t down to a greenish layer. Green? This color is found only in chlorophyll=
=2C which makes new leaves green; reserves of chlorophyll are also stored=
 in the trunks of living trees. That could mean only one thing: this piece=
 of wood was still alive! I suddenly noticed that the remaining =E2=80=9Cs=
tones=E2=80=9D formed a distinct pattern: they were arranged in a circle w=
ith a diameter of about 5 feet. What I had stumbled upon were the gnarled
remains of an enormous ancient tree stump. All that was left were vestiges=
 of the outermost edge. The interior had completely rotted into humus long=
 ago =E2=80=94 a clear indication that the tree must have been felled at l=
east four or five hundred years earlier.

How can a tree cut down centuries ago could still be alive? Without leaves=
=2C a tree is unable to perform photosynthesis=2C which is how it converts=
 sunlight into sugar for sustenance. The ancient tree was clearly receivin=
g nutrients in some other way =E2=80=94 for hundreds of years.

Beneath the mystery lay a fascinating frontier of scientific research=2C w=
hich would eventually reveal that this tree was not unique in its assisted=
 living. Neighboring trees=2C scientists found=2C help each other through=
 their root systems =E2=80=94 either directly=2C by intertwining their roo=
ts=2C or indirectly=2C by growing fungal networks around the roots that se=
rve as a sort of extended nervous system connecting separate trees. If thi=
s weren=E2=80=99t remarkable enough=2C these arboreal mutualities are even=
 more complex =E2=80=94 trees appear able to distinguish their own roots f=
rom those of other species and even of their own relatives.

/2015/01/09/theas-tree-judith-clay/?mc_cid=3D533d31dcb0&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]=
)

Wohlleben ponders this astonishing sociality of trees=2C abounding with wi=
sdom about what makes strong human communities and societies:

Why are trees such social beings? Why do they share food with their own sp=
ecies and sometimes even go so far as to nourish their competitors? The re=
asons are the same as for human communities: there are advantages to worki=
ng together. A tree is not a forest. On its own=2C a tree cannot establish=
 a consistent local climate. It is at the mercy of wind and weather. But t=
ogether=2C many trees create an ecosystem that moderates extremes of heat=
 and cold=2C stores a great deal of water=2C and generates a great deal of=
 humidity. And in this protected environment=2C trees can live to be very=
 old. To get to this point=2C the community must remain intact no matter w=
hat. If every tree were looking out only for itself=2C then quite a few of=
 them would never reach old age. Regular fatalities would result in many l=
arge gaps in the tree canopy=2C which would make it easier for storms to g=
et inside the forest and uproot more trees. The heat of summer would reach=
 the forest floor and dry it out. Every
tree would suffer.

Every tree=2C therefore=2C is valuable to the community and worth keeping=
 around for as long as possible. And that is why even sick individuals are=
 supported and nourished until they recover. Next time=2C perhaps it will=
 be the other way round=2C and the supporting tree might be the one in nee=
d of assistance.

[=E2=80=A6]

A tree can be only as strong as the forest that surrounds it.

One can=E2=80=99t help but wonder whether trees are so much better equippe=
d at this mutual care than we are because of the different time-scales on=
 which our respective existences play out. Is some of our inability to see=
 this bigger picture of shared sustenance in human communities a function=
 of our biological short-sightedness? Are organisms who live on different=
 time scales better able to act in accordance with this grander scheme of=
 things in a universe that is deeply interconnected (https://www.brainpick=
ings.org/2015/11/28/dark-matter-and-the-dinosaurs-lisa-randall/?mc_cid=3D5=
33d31dcb0&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) ?

To be sure=2C even trees are discriminating in their kinship=2C which they=
 extend in varying degrees. Wohlleben explains:

Every tree is a member of this community=2C but there are different levels=
 of membership. For example=2C most stumps rot away into humus and disappe=
ar within a couple of hundred years (which is not very long for a tree). O=
nly a few individuals are kept alive over the centuries=E2=80=A6 What=E2=
=80=99s the difference? Do tree societies have second-class citizens just=
 like human societies? It seems they do=2C though the idea of =E2=80=9Ccla=
ss=E2=80=9D doesn=E2=80=99t quite fit. It is rather the degree of connecti=
on =E2=80=94 or maybe even affection =E2=80=94 that decides how helpful a=
 tree=E2=80=99s colleagues will be.

These relationships=2C Wohlleben points out=2C are encoded in the forest c=
anopy and visible to anyone who simply looks up:

The average tree grows its branches out until it encounters the branch tip=
s of a neighboring tree of the same height. It doesn=E2=80=99t grow any wi=
der because the air and better light in this space are already taken. Howe=
ver=2C it heavily reinforces the branches it has extended=2C so you get th=
e impression that there=E2=80=99s quite a shoving match going on up there.=
 But a pair of true friends is careful right from the outset not to grow o=
verly thick branches in each other=E2=80=99s direction. The trees don=E2=
=80=99t want to take anything away from each other=2C and so they develop=
 sturdy branches only at the outer edges of their crowns=2C that is to say=
=2C only in the direction of =E2=80=9Cnon-friends.=E2=80=9D Such partners=
 are often so tightly connected at the roots that sometimes they even die=
 together.

Art by C=C3=A9cile Gambini from Strange Trees (https://www.brainpickings.o=
rg/2016/06/09/strange-trees/?mc_cid=3D533d31dcb0&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) by Be=
rnadette Pourqui=C3=A9

But trees don=E2=80=99t interact with one another in isolation from the re=
st of the ecosystem. The substance of their communication=2C in fact=2C is=
 often about and even to other species. Wohlleben describes their particul=
arly remarkable olfactory warning system:

Four decades ago=2C scientists noticed something on the African savannah.=
 The giraffes there were feeding on umbrella thorn acacias=2C and the tree=
s didn=E2=80=99t like this one bit. It took the acacias mere minutes to st=
art pumping toxic substances into their leaves to rid themselves of the la=
rge herbivores. The giraffes got the message and moved on to other trees i=
n the vicinity. But did they move on to trees close by? No=2C for the time=
 being=2C they walked right by a few trees and resumed their meal only whe=
n they had moved about 100 yards away.

The reason for this behavior is astonishing. The acacia trees that were be=
ing eaten gave off a warning gas (specifically=2C ethylene) that signaled=
 to neighboring trees of the same species that a crisis was at hand. Right=
 away=2C all the forewarned trees also pumped toxins into their leaves to=
 prepare themselves. The giraffes were wise to this game and therefore mov=
ed farther away to a part of the savannah where they could find trees that=
 were oblivious to what was going on. Or else they moved upwind. For the s=
cent messages are carried to nearby trees on the breeze=2C and if the anim=
als walked upwind=2C they could find acacias close by that had no idea the=
 giraffes were there.

Because trees operate on time scales dramatically more extended than our o=
wn=2C they operate far more slowly than we do =E2=80=94 their electrical i=
mpulses crawl at the speed of a third of an inch per second. Wohlleben wri=
tes:

Beeches=2C spruce=2C and oaks all register pain as soon as some creature s=
tarts nibbling on them. When a caterpillar takes a hearty bite out of a le=
af=2C the tissue around the site of the damage changes. In addition=2C the=
 leaf tissue sends out electrical signals=2C just as human tissue does whe=
n it is hurt. However=2C the signal is not transmitted in milliseconds=2C=
 as human signals are; instead=2C the plant signal travels at the slow spe=
ed of a third of an inch per minute. Accordingly=2C it takes an hour or so=
 before defensive compounds reach the leaves to spoil the pest=E2=80=99s m=
eal. Trees live their lives in the really slow lane=2C even when they are=
 in danger. But this slow tempo doesn=E2=80=99t mean that a tree is not on=
 top of what is happening in different parts of its structure. If the root=
s find themselves in trouble=2C this information is broadcast throughout t=
he tree=2C which can trigger the leaves to release scent compounds. And no=
t just any old scent compounds=2C but compounds that are specifically
formulated for the task at hand.

The upside of this incapacity for speed is that there is no need for blank=
et alarmism =E2=80=94 the recompense of trees=E2=80=99 inherent slowness i=
s an extreme precision of signal. In addition to smell=2C they also use ta=
ste =E2=80=94 each species produces a different kind of =E2=80=9Csaliva=2C=
=E2=80=9D which can be infused with different pheromones targeted at wardi=
ng off a specific predator.

Wohlleben illustrates the centrality of trees in Earth=E2=80=99s ecosystem=
 with a story about Yellowstone National Park that demonstrates =E2=80=9Ch=
ow our appreciation for trees affects the way we interact with the world a=
round us=E2=80=9D:

It all starts with the wolves. Wolves disappeared from Yellowstone=2C the=
 world=E2=80=99s first national park=2C in the 1920s. When they left=2C th=
e entire ecosystem changed. Elk herds in the park increased their numbers=
 and began to make quite a meal of the aspens=2C willows=2C and cottonwood=
s that lined the streams. Vegetation declined and animals that depended on=
 the trees left. The wolves were absent for seventy years. When they retur=
ned=2C the elks=E2=80=99 languorous browsing days were over. As the wolf p=
acks kept the herds on the move=2C browsing diminished=2C and the trees sp=
rang back. The roots of cottonwoods and willows once again stabilized stre=
am banks and slowed the flow of water. This=2C in turn=2C created space fo=
r animals such as beavers to return. These industrious builders could now=
 find the materials they needed to construct their lodges and raise their=
 families. The animals that depended on the riparian meadows came back=2C=
 as well. The wolves turned out to be better stewards of the land
than people=2C creating conditions that allowed the trees to grow and exer=
t their influence on the landscape.

gs.org/2016/08/18/wolves-of-currumpaw-william-grill/?mc_cid=3D533d31dcb0&m=
c_eid=3D[UNIQID])

This interconnectedness isn=E2=80=99t limited to regional ecosystems. Wohl=
leben cites the work of Japanese marine chemist Katsuhiko Matsunaga=2C who=
 discovered that trees falling into a river can change the acidity of the=
 water and thus stimulate the growth of plankton =E2=80=94 the elemental a=

=2C richest=2C truest answer of all comes from Rainer Maria Rilke (Decembe=

 invaluable packets of wisdom on writing and life=2C which Rilke bequeathe=
d to a 19-year-old cadet and budding poet named Franz Xaver Kappus.

1902 portrait of Rainer Maria Rilke by Helmuth Westhoff=2C Rilke=E2=80=99s=
 brother-in-law

In the very first installment from their now-iconic correspondence=2C the=
 young poet shares some of his writing with his mentor and extends the sim=
ple=2C enormously difficult question of how one knows one is a writer. Ech=
oing Nietzsche=E2=80=99s famous assertion that =E2=80=9Cno one can build y=
ou the bridge on which you=2C and only you=2C must cross the river of life=
=2C=E2=80=9D (https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/09/30/nietzsche-find-your=
self-schopenhauer-as-educator/?mc_cid=3D533d31dcb0&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) Ril=
ke offers:

Nobody can counsel and help you=2C nobody. There is only one single way. G=
o into yourself. Search for the reason that bids you write; find out wheth=
er it is spreading out its roots in the deepest places of your heart=2C ac=
knowledge to yourself whether you would have to die if it were denied you=
 to write.

In a sentiment that calls to mind Bukowski=E2=80=99s incantation from his=
 poem =E2=80=9CSo you want to be a writer=E2=80=9D (https://www.brainpicki=
ngs.org/2012/10/19/so-you-want-to-be-a-writer-charles-bukowski/?mc_cid=3D5=
33d31dcb0&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) =E2=80=94 =E2=80=9Cunless it comes out of yo=
ur soul like a rocket =E2=80=A6 don=E2=80=99t do it=2C=E2=80=9D he admonis=
hed =E2=80=94 Rilke adds:

This above all =E2=80=94 ask yourself in the stillest hour of your night:=
 must I write? Delve into yourself for a deep answer. And if this should b=
e affirmative=2C if you may meet this earnest question with a strong and s=
imple =E2=80=9CI must=2C=E2=80=9D then build your life according to this n=
ecessity; your life even into its most indifferent and slightest hour must=
 be a sign of this urge and a testimony to it.

[=E2=80=A6]

A work of art is good if it has sprung from necessity. In this nature of i=
ts origin lies the judgment of it: there is no other.

But despite his opening caveat=2C Rilke does offer young Kappus advice bot=
h practical and poetic:

Try=2C like some first human being=2C to say what you see and experience a=
nd love and lose. Do not write love-poems; avoid at first those forms that=
 are too facile and commonplace: they are the most difficult=2C for it tak=
es a great=2C fully matured power to give something of your own where good=
 and even excellent traditions come to mind in quantity. Therefore save yo=
urself from these general themes and seek those which your own everyday li=
fe offers you; describe your sorrows and desires=2C passing thoughts and t=
he belief in some sort of beauty =E2=80=94 describe all these with loving=
=2C quiet=2C humble sincerity=2C and use=2C to express yourself=2C the thi=
ngs in your environment=2C the images from your dreams=2C and the objects=
 of your memory. If your daily life seems poor=2C do not blame it; blame y=
ourself=2C tell yourself that you are not poet enough to call forth its ri=
ches; for to the creator there is no poverty and no poor indifferent place=
=2E

Rilke concludes with a numinous definition of what it means=2C and what it=
 takes=2C to be an artist:

I know no advice for you save this: to go into yourself and test the deeps=
 in which your life takes rise; at its source you will find the answer to=
 the question whether you must create. Accept it=2C just as it sounds=2C w=
ithout inquiring into it. Perhaps it will turn out that you are called to=
 be an artist. Then take that destiny upon yourself and bear it=2C its bur=
den and its greatness=2C without ever asking what recompense might come fr=
om outside. For the creator must be a world for himself and find everythin=
g in himself and in Nature to whom he has attached himself.

 I was surprised at how hard the =E2=80=9Cstone=E2=80=9D was=2C because it=

etknife and carefully scraped away some of the bark until I got down to a=
 greenish layer. Green? This color is found only in chlorophyll=2C which m=
akes new leaves green; reserves of chlorophyll are also stored in the trun=
ks of living trees. That could mean only one thing: this piece of wood was=
 still alive! I suddenly noticed that the remaining =E2=80=9Cstones=E2=80=
=9D formed a distinct pattern: they were arranged in a circle with a diame=
ter of about 5 feet. What I had stumbled upon were the gnarled remains of=
 an enormous ancient tree stump. All that was left were vestiges of the ou=

k the acacias mere minutes to start pumping toxic substances into their le=
aves to rid themselves of the large herbivores. The giraffes got the messa=
ge and moved on to other trees in the vicinity. But did they move on to tr=

 acacia trees that were being eaten gave off a warning gas (specifically=
=2C ethylene) that signaled to neighboring trees of the same species that=
 a crisis was at hand. Right away=2C all the forewarned trees also pumped=
 toxins into their leaves to prepare themselves. The giraffes were wise to=
 this game and therefore moved farther away to a part of the savannah wher=
e they could find trees that were oblivious to what was going on. Or else=
 they moved upwind. For the scent messages are carried to nearby trees on=
