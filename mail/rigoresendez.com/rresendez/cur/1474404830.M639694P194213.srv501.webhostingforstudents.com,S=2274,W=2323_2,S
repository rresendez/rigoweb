Hi:

I want to share with you a first event-I have no reservations for the test we have scheduled for this Sat, Sept 24.

It is entirely possible that my list of registrations is in error, so let me ask you for one of two things: A: Correct my blank list, with my apology B: Make a reservation by calling me at 210-637-6161 or emailing me at the above address.

Please.

Roy
