I was thinking the other day, it really bum be out what happened to you on
IBM and whole MS CS story. 

I believe you are capable and should get back on the industry specially
since you have kids. I once spoke with this YouTube celebrity guy called
Eli the computer guy , he is quite famous on the IT circles. I pay to
speak to him through skype for an hour , and the best advice I got from
him was Udacity. Udacity is Google's online school , you can get a
nano-degree in less than an year. The cool part is that if you take the
200 dlls a month option and you finish ,google guarantees to find you a
job with them or a similar category corporation . Also if you finish the
course in less than a year they will reimburse half of your tuition . I
began mine but find it to challenging and I did not have the time . I'm no
getting paid or have any relation to the service. I'm telling you this
because ,Is one of the only certain ways to land a very well paid job
warrantee . Hope this helps and see you on Tuesday.
